<t> The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to consider when designing the remote. </t>  <t> The user interface designer presented two existing products and discussed what was wrong with each product. </t>  <t> The team discussed how to create a remote which did not include the problems present in the existing products presented by the interface specialist. </t>  <t> The marketing expert presented consumer preferences and requirements and the team discussed who their target demographic should be and whether to include speech recognition in their product. </t>  <t> The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed various options for components and energy sources. </t>  <t> The team then discussed features to include in the remote and what they could do to figure out how to categorize them. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will work on the components concept. </t>  <t> The user interface designer will work on the user interface. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will work on trend watching </t>  <t> The team will not work with teletext. </t>  <t> The remote will only control televisions. </t>  <t> The corporate color and design must be incorporated into the design of the remote. </t>  <t> The remote will have buttons for the following functions: on and off, channel up and down, volume up and down, and entering channel numbers. </t>  <t> The remote has to look good and be easy to use. </t>  <t> The target demographic is people aged fifteen to thirty five. </t>  <t> The remote will use an infra-red sensor. </t>  <t> The remote will use regular batteries. </t>  <t> How to categorize the functions on the remote. </t>  <t> How to implement the categorization of functions in the design of the remote. </t>  <t> Defining a target demographic. </t>  <t> Whether to include speech recognition as a feature in the remote. </t>  <t> How to incorporate more advanced functions into the remote while keeping the design and usability of the remote simple. </t> 
<t> The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. </t>  <t> The marketing expert discussed his findings from trend watching reports, stressing the need for a product that has a fancy look and feel, is technologically innovative, is easy to use, and incorporates some aspect of fruit and vegetables in its design. </t>  <t> The interface specialist presented research on the appearance of current remotes, concluding that current remotes are generally unappealing in terms of look and usability. </t>  <t> The interface specialist presented ideas on how to remedy the unappealing aspects of current remotes in the team's design and also how to incorporate the corporate color scheme into the design. </t>  <t> The industrial designer presented options for materials, components, and batteries and discussed the restrictions involved in using certain materials. </t>  <t> The team then discussed options for the shape and color scheme of the remote, as well as what components, batteries, and materials to use. </t>  <t> Some team members will design a prototype of the remote </t>  <t> The remote will be curvy. </t>  <t> The remote will be shaped like a snowman. </t>  <t> The remote will not have a talk-back function. </t>  <t> The remote will have a jog dial. </t>  <t> The materials used will be plastic and rubber. </t>  <t> The case will have a soft fruit-like feel to it. </t>  <t> The remote will not have an LCD display. </t>  <t> The remote will have a kinetic battery. </t>  <t> The remote will have rubber buttons. </t>  <t> What sort of battery to use. </t>  <t> How to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, the corporate color, and soft materials into the remote. </t>  <t> What shape the remote should be. </t>  <t> Whether the remote should have a talk-back function. </t>  <t> Whether to have an LCD display on the remote. </t>  <t> What the case will look like. </t>  <t> Whether to include a jog dial on the remote. </t> 
<t> The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented their prototype and discussed the features the prototype contained. </t>  <t> The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and had to decide which features to retain or lose in order to maintain the target cost. </t>  <t> In maintaining the target cost, the team had to lose a number of features which they originally wanted, such as a kinetic battery, an LCD display, and various color options. </t>  <t> The team then evaluated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, technological innovation, and spongy quality. </t>  <t> The prototype did fairly well in the evaluation. </t>  <t> The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process. </t>  <t> The team felt that their creativity was hindered by the project budget and their inability to discuss the project outside of their meetings and that the structure of the task did not foster teamwork. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> The remote will not contain a kinetic battery. </t>  <t> The remote will have a regular chip. </t>  <t> The case will be double-curved. </t>  <t> The remote will have push buttons. </t>  <t> The remote will not feature an LCD display. </t>  <t> The display will be on the television instead of on the remote. </t>  <t> The buttons will be normal colored. </t>  <t> The remote will have square buttons. </t>  <t> Meeting the target cost. </t> 
<t> The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. </t>  <t> They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. </t>  <t> They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. </t>  <t> The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert will examine the features and design of competitors' remotes. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer will research possible shapes and colors for the device. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer will research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device. </t>  <t> NA. </t>  <t> NA. </t> 
<t> The Marketing Expert presented requirements of users as found in a company market study. </t>  <t> The study showed that users want a fancier-looking but uncomplicated remote control, and are interested in speech recognition. </t>  <t> He presented the age groups polled and said that the target marketing group should be users aged fifteen to thirty-five. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer presented several competitors' remotes and discussed the features that would make their own device more user-friendly. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on important internal components that would keep the project within its budget, and discussed possible materials and programmable features. </t>  <t> The Project Manager gave several new requirements for the project to the group. </t>  <t> The group discussed the features they would like to incorporate into the design in light of the new requirements and budget constraints. </t>  <t> They decided to keep speech recognition as one of their components, and decided to include some programmable features, limit the number of button functions, and make the remote yellow and glow-in-the-dark, in an organic shape. </t>  <t> The Program Manager said that he would ask to what extent the company motto had to be incorporated into the design. </t>  <t> The Project Manager will ask to what extent the company logo must be incorporated into the design. </t>  <t> The remote will feature speech recognition and programmable channel and volume preferences. </t>  <t> The number of button functions will be limited to make the remote user-friendly. </t>  <t> The remote will have an organic shape and feature some yellow coloring and glow-in-the-dark material. </t>  <t> The group seemed to have some minor technical difficulties when opening their presentations. </t> 
<t> The Marketing Expert presented the results of a market survey that indicated users' most important preferences in remote control features. </t>  <t> He discussed trends in fashion that should be incorporated into the prototype design. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer compared the designs of several competitors' remotes to decide which features should be used in their own design. </t>  <t> She discussed using voice recognition, an LCD screen, and color to make the device easier to use and to improve its look. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer went over all of the internal components and materials that will be incorporated in the design. </t>  <t> He gave a layout of the placement of the components in the device. </t>  <t> The group decided to use a rubber or latex material to give the device a spongy feel. </t>  <t> He discussed the color and shape of the remote with the group and the placement of the components on the device. </t>  <t> The group discussed colors and shapes further, and decided that the remote will be yellow, and perhaps having a fruit-inspired shape. </t>  <t> The group decided to use a rechargeable battery and recharging stand. </t>  <t> The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will build a prototype out of clay for the next meeting. </t>  <t> The remote will feature a rubber or latex casing. </t>  <t> Several shapes will be designed and shown to the public so that the most popular shape is chosen. </t>  <t> The remote will be yellow or partially yellow and have an organic shape. </t>  <t> The remote will feature speech recognition. </t>  <t> The remote will be powered by rechargeable batteries and come with a recharging stand. </t>  <t> The group had difficulty deciding how to incorporate the company's yellow color and the fruit and vegetable trend into the prototype design without the remote seeming overly gimmicky or childish. </t> 
<t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototypes to the group. </t>  <t> Two prototypes featured different fruit shapes, with one including speech recognition instead of a large number of buttons. </t>  <t> It also featured scroll wheels for channel control. </t>  <t> The other prototype was designed like a banana with children users in mind. </t>  <t> The Project Manager announced to the group that with all of their desired features, the project would go over the alotted budget; after a reanalysis of the features of the prototype, the project came in under the budget instead. </t>  <t> It was decided that another feature could possibly be added. </t>  <t> The group evaluated their effectiveness as a team and felt that all members worked well together and could be creative, and that the project had very good leadership. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype according to the initial project goals; the evaluation showed that most of the goals had been sufficiently satisfied in order to launch the product. </t>  <t> The remote will come in several designs: two will have different fruit or vegetable shapes, one of which will feature speech recognition in lieu of a large number of buttons. </t>  <t> There will also be a child-friendly banana-shaped remote. </t>  <t> Both the company name and slogan will appear on the remote. </t>  <t> The remotes will be bundled with a yellow charging stand. </t>  <t> The devices were made with a latex product with a rubbery texture. </t>  <t> It was decided that the product had met enough of the initial project goals to be launched on the market. </t>  <t> The Project Manager felt that the group had been too constrained by the budget. </t>  <t> Some felt that the banana shape would not appeal to enough of the market and that there was not enough variety in shape in the remotes to make up for this problem. </t> 
<t> The project manager opens the meeting by going over the agenda. </t>  <t> She explains the project, which is to create a new remote control for television that should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. </t>  <t> The three components of completing the project will be functional, conceptual, and detailed design. </t>  <t> They introduce themselves by going up to the white board and stating their name, role, drawing their favorite animal, and sharing their favorite characteristic about the animal. </t>  <t> After they talk about their overall budget, they discuss what special features they want to include in this remote control that existing ones do not have. </t>  <t> They discuss making a menu-based remote which would be less crowded with buttons and therefore stylish and sleek but functional. </t>  <t> They end the meeting with the project manager going over the task each member is to complete before the next meeting. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will work on user requirements specification. </t>  <t> The interface specialist will look at the working design. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will work on the technical functions design. </t>  <t> They will get specific instructions when they get back to their workspace. </t>  <t> They will sell the remotes for twenty five Euros each. </t>  <t> They will aim for a profit of fifty million Euros. </t>  <t> The remotes will target the international market. </t>  <t> The group got the idea of making a menu-based remote that would require very few buttons to operate. </t>  <t> Although this is an original idea, one group member points out that may be too innovative and users could have difficulty learning how to operate it. </t>  <t> They did not yet come to a decision about whether this idea should be implemented. </t> 
<t> The project manager opens the meeting by stating that they will address functional design and then going over the agenda. </t>  <t> The industrial designer gives his presentation, explaining how remote controls function and giving personal preference to a clear, simple design that upgrades the technology as well as incorporates the latest features in chip design. </t>  <t> The interface specialist gives her presentation next, addressing the main purpose of a remote control. </t>  <t> She pinpoints the main functions of on/off, channel-switching, numbers for choosing particular channels, and volume; and also suggests adding a menu button to change settings such as brightness on the screen. </t>  <t> She gives preference to a remote that is small, easy to use, and follows some conventions. </t>  <t> The group briefly discusses the possibility of using an LCD screen if cost allows it, since it is fancy and fashionable. </t>  <t> The marketing expert presents, giving statistical information from a survey of 100 subjects. </t>  <t> She prefers a remote that is sleek, stylish, sophisticated, cool, beautiful, functional, solar-powered, has long battery life, and has a locator. </t>  <t> They discuss the target group, deciding it should be 15-35 year olds. </t>  <t> After they talk about features they might include, the project manager closes the meeting by allocating tasks. </t>  <t> When they return to their desks they will complete a questionaire, do a summary, and send the project manager their powerpoint presentations. </t>  <t> The interface specialist will look at the user interface concept. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will be watching trends (possibly relating to voice recognition). </t>  <t> The industrial designer will look into components </t>  <t> The group is interested in voice recognition- this is an option they will have to explore further before deciding whether to use it. </t> 
<t> The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. </t>  <t> The industrial designer begins presenting, first describing the insides of a remote control. </t>  <t> He lists the options for types of batteries, shapes for the remote case, materials to use, and functions to include such as push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCD screens. </t>  <t> He then talks about the type of chip certain features would require. </t>  <t> The interface specialist begins presenting, first defining user interface and then showing some examples of remotes. </t>  <t> She mentions that many existing remotes do not have a nice appearance, and states her preference for a remote that is small and simple and contains a scrolling wheel. </t>  <t> The marketing expert gives her presentation about user requirements and current trends. </t>  <t> She shares that fruits and vegetables are popular, meaning curviness and assymetry are in. </t>  <t> The group decides to use LCD screens to give the remote style. </t>  <t> They discuss what material should be used, talk about how the surface of the case should look, and plan out the general user interface. </t>  <t> After they make some decisions about the remote, the project manager closes the meeting by telling them what their tasks will be until the next meeting. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer will work on look and feel. </t>  <t> The Interface Specialist will work on user interface. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert will work on the product evaluation. </t>  <t> The two designers will work together on developing a prototype using modeling glay and follow the instructions the group has come up. </t>  <t> They will get extra instructions from their personal coach </t>  <t> The remote control and its buttons will be made of rubber. </t>  <t> The case will be flat on top and curved on the bottom. </t>  <t> The remote will have push buttons outside, and an LCD and spinning wheel inside. </t>  <t> The remote will resemble a vegetable and be in bright vegetable colors. </t>  <t> It will have voice recognition, use a simple battery, and contain an advanced chip. </t>  <t> It will have standard on/off, channel-changing, numerical, and volume buttons, with a menu on the screen. </t>  <t> *NA*. </t> 
<t> The project manager opens this detailed design meeting by going over the agenda. </t>  <t> The designers present the prototype, which they decided to make the color and shape of a banana. </t>  <t> They demonstrate the remote components, showing how it flips open on the side and features a LCD and scroll inside. </t>  <t> The marketing expert gives the product evaluation, which is based on the criteria of attractiveness, whether it matches operation behavior of the user, locatability, intuitiveness, ergonomic design, and how technologically innovative it is. </t>  <t> They rate the product using a 7 point scale and come up with an average score of 6.5. </t>  <t> The group goes on to calculate the production cost and finds they are over the budget. </t>  <t> They have discussion and decide to eliminate the sample speaker locator and the scroll wheel inside. </t>  <t> The team discusses the project process- saying that they had to cut out some creativity in order to meet the budget because they had not known the cost of features beforehand. </t>  <t> They were satisfied with the leadership but felt rushed for time. </t>  <t> They finish the meeting 5 minutes early and the project manager tells them what is left to complete. </t>  <t> The team needs to complete the final questionaire and meeting summary. </t>  <t> The remote will be black/yellow color and the shape of a banana. </t>  <t> Remote flips open on side. </t>  <t> LCD and push buttons inside flip-open door. </t>  <t> The LCD will display the main menu, which offers various options. </t>  <t> Has an on/off button, channel flipping, volume scroller on side. </t>  <t> Corporate logo will be in grey. </t>  <t> Remote uses one simple battery and an advanced chip. </t>  <t> Single-curved surface. </t>  <t> Rubber case material. </t>  <t> Locator will have a beep instead of a speaker. </t>  <t> When rating the product on how well it matches the user's behavior, they found that the product is more convenient for right-handed people and less so for those who are left-handed. </t>  <t> When rating whether the product is intuitive, the layout is different,a good technology but less standard. </t>  <t> It could be more difficult to get used to. </t>  <t> The team had to cut out some features in order to make the budget. </t>  <t> This happened because they had not known beforehand the cost of such features. </t> 
<t> The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals and discussed why they liked those particular animals. </t>  <t> The project manager discussed the project finances and the team engaged in a brainstorming session about various features to consider in designing a remote. </t>  <t> The project manager then further discussed the roles of the team members. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> The selling price of the remote will be 25 Euro. </t>  <t> The profit aim will be 50 million Euro. </t>  <t> The remote will be sold internationally. </t>  <t> The production cost cannot exceed 12.50 Euro. </t>  <t> The remote will have a lock function. </t>  <t> The remote will control televisions and devices connected to televisions. </t>  <t> The team will create a back-up plan for a remote that only controls televisions </t>  <t> If the remote should be used only for televisions or if it should be capable of controlling other devices also. </t>  <t> Having a two sided remote with basic functions on one side and advanced functions on the other. </t>

<t> The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented three prototypes which differed primarily in shape. </t>  <t> The team felt it was not necessary to include a feature to prevent the remote from getting lost as the prototype designs were quite bright. </t>  <t> The team conducted a product evaluation of the prototype the team liked the most. </t>  <t> They rated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, functionality, technological innovativeness, sponginess, usability, learn-ability, its ability to be found when misplaced, simplicity, and its ability to meet the appropriate demographic. </t>  <t> The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. </t>  <t> The project manager then led the team in a project evaluation in which the team evaluated how they created the project, the information they found and used, their creativity, their teamwork, and the materials they had at their disposal. </t>  <t> The team was generally quite satisfied. </t>  <t> After the project manager's closing, the team discussed their personal preferences in terms of the prototypes. </t>  <t> They also further evaluated the project process and discussed what they had learned. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> The remote will resemble the potato prototype. </t>  <t> There will be no feature to help find the remote when it is misplaced; instead the remote will be in a bright color to address this issue. </t>  <t> The corporate logo will be on the remote. </t>  <t> One of the color concepts for the remote will contain the corporate colors. </t>  <t> The remote will have six buttons. </t>  <t> The buttons will all be one color. </t>  <t> The case will be single curve. </t>  <t> The case will be made of rubber. </t>  <t> The case will have a special color. </t>  <t> Whether or not to have a feature which helps find the remote when it is misplaced. </t> 
<t> The Project Manager presented the project to the other participants by discussing the aim of creating a new, fashionable remote control device and defined the roles and tasks of each participant. </t>  <t> The group introduced themselves to each other and trained themselves how to use the whiteboard tools. </t>  <t> The Project Manager discussed the financial goals of the project, including the projected profit aim and price point for the device. </t>  <t> The Project Manager gave each participant their assignments. </t>  <t> The group then began a discussion of their initial ideas about the remote control and possible features. </t>  <t> The Project Manager announced that he would make a report containing the discussion of the group's initial ideas about the device. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer will prepare a definition of the basic functions that the remote control device will have. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert will define the needs and desires of the user. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer will receive further assignments at a later time. </t>  <t> The Project Manager will prepare a report of the initial ideas discussed during the meeting. </t>  <t> The group decided to consider the following features for the remote control device: universal compatibility with different types of video formatting, combination with other types of devices, and interchangeable faceplates. </t>  <t> NA. </t> 
<t> The Project Manager went over new requirements for the project: that the device was solely to control television, and that there would not be a teletext component. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic components of a remote control device, and advised the group to use plastic for the casing material instead of metal. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer presented the technical functions of remote controls and compared the interfaces of two existing remote control products. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert made a presentation of the needs and the desires of the consumer and emphasized simplicity as one of the most desired features. </t>  <t> The group discussed in more detail the features that will be added to the device: the possible applications of voice recognition, the touch screen menu interface, faceplates, and the look of the company logo. </t>  <t> The Project Manager will post the discussion notes and the meeting's minutes to be available to all the participants. </t>  <t> The group decided to use plastic as their casing material instead of metal. </t>  <t> The marketing will be focused towards the youth market. </t>  <t> The group decided to keep the touch screen interface, and to keep the main interface simple. </t>  <t> The remote will have a locating device that operates either through voice recognition or through paging. </t>  <t> The company logo will appear in a brief flash in the boot-up screen of the device. </t>  <t> The group had problems with sacrificing popular features in order to stay within the project budget. </t> 
<t> The Industrial Designer presented an analysis of cost and the manufacturing options that were available to the group. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert presented market trends and the organic trend that this project would adopt. </t>  <t> She discussed materials that could be used to follow this trend. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer presented several interface concepts including voice recognition, a spinning wheel design, and a touch screen interface. </t>  <t> The group then discussed the features of the device. </t>  <t> They discussed the costs and benefits of using either voice recognition or the touch screen interface, and decided on voice recognition based on their marketing data that favored it. </t>  <t> They decided to use solar power to power the device. </t>  <t> The group discussed the non-traditional look the device could have since the voice recognition would allow it to be stationary. </t>  <t> They discussed using rubber for the case. </t>  <t> The group talked about hiding the complicated functions from the main interface, using rubber for the buttons, and having different cases to suit different tastes. </t>  <t> The Project Manager reiterated that the product was being marketed towards the youth market, and then gave out assignments and instructed the group to work together to build the prototype. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer, the User Interface Designer, and the Marketing Expert were instructed to work together on making the prototype of the remote control. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer will build the look of the device using the new manufacturing constraints that were presented. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer was assigned the task of making the design layout of the device. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert was instructed to check the evaluations of the prototype. </t>  <t> The group realized that it would be too costly to add both a voice recognition component and a touch screen, so they decided between the two and will now only add the voice recognition component. </t>  <t> The group decided to have optional alternative cases for the device to suit different consumer tastes. </t>  <t> It was also decided that the remote will not have the traditional look of a hand-held remote since it can be stationary with voice recognition software. </t>  <t> The remote control will be made of a soft rubber material. </t>  <t> The device will be powered by solar power, with a small backup battery. </t>  <t> There were difficulties deciding between adding extra features and staying within the project budget. </t>  <t> The participants had problems projecting how much each added feature would drive up the price point of the device because there was a lack of data on manufacturing cost. </t> 
<t> The Project Manager opened the meeting by reviewing the decisions from the previous meeting (to use voice recognition instead of the touch screen, to hide the complicated features, and to start building the prototype). </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer then presented the prototype that featured voice recognition, interchangeable cases, visible light, and a soft casing material. </t>  <t> The Project Manager presented what each component cost, which showed that the project was going over the alotted budget; the group decided to remove the solar panel. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert presented an evaluation of the prototype and showed that the prototype had met many of the initial goals. </t>  <t> The group then evaluated the project process and discussed their effectiveness as a group. </t>  <t> The Project Manager summarized the proceedings of the meeting which will go into a final report, along with comments made during the project evaluation. </t>  <t> The Project Manager will create a final report containing the summary of the meeting proceedings, including the evaluation of the project process. </t>  <t> The group decided to remove the solar panel in order to keep the price point of the device close to the original goal. </t>  <t> The designers of the prototype decided to use several different colors in the visible light stream in the device. </t>  <t> They also decided to use classic rubber buttons instead of more costly scroll buttons. </t>  <t> The group encountered a problem with a lack of information about their specific tasks. </t>  <t> They also felt it difficult to bring creativity to the project because of the budget constraints. </t> 
<t> The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave an agenda for the project as a whole. </t>  <t> She then introduced a tool training exercise to acquaint the group with the meeting-room tools and to help them get to know each other. </t>  <t> The Project Manager then presented the project budget to the group and presented the projected profit aim, the production cost, and the price point of the device. </t>  <t> The group then began a discussion about features of remote controls and their own  experiences with them. </t>  <t> They discussed making the remote universally compatible and ergonomically-designed, and types of batteries to use. </t>  <t> The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to work on the internal working design of the device. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer was told to work on the technical function design, and the Marketing Expert was instructed to research the needs of users. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer will work on the internal working design. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer will work on the technical function design. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert will research user requirements. </t>  <t> NA. </t>  <t> NA. </t>

<t> The project manager opens the meeting, asking the industrial designer to present first. </t>  <t> The industrial designer begins talking about the functional aspect of the working design and features to make the product unique, such as visibility in the dark, locator alarm, and environmentally-friendly materials. </t>  <t> To make an environmental impact, they could use smart materials that can be heated and cooled so that the individual components easily separate to be reused or recycled. </t>  <t> The group asks some questions about this idea and then the interface designer presents about technical functions, explaining the difference between a multifunctional and single function remote. </t>  <t> The group discusses the two types and decides that a single function design is more suitable for the budget. </t>  <t> The marketing expert presents on user requirements by using research done on remote control users. </t>  <t> She summarizes these findings andexplains her personal preference for a user-friendly, unique design since certain features could be too complex. </t>  <t> The project manager receives some decision-affecting information from management, which she shares with the group. </t>  <t> They have a discussion about the remote control functions and close the meeting. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> The remote will be a single function design- television only. </t>  <t> Teletext is outdated and will not be used. </t>  <t> Remotes must incorporate corporate logo and color. </t>  <t> No LCD, no voice recognition. </t>  <t> Alarm locator will be implemented. </t>  <t> Glow in the dark buttons, self-timed lighting. </t>  <t> Will consider using number-shaped buttons. </t>  <t> Will research changable covers. </t>  <t> Will reserach environmental factor. </t>  <t> Need to research on whether locator device will need a separate battery. </t>  <t> Need to research possibility of changable covers. </t>  <t> Need to research using envrionemntal materials. </t> 
<t> The project manager opens this conceptual design meeting and gives them the agenda. </t>  <t> The industrial designer presents first and talks about the components of a remote, energy source options, and materials for the remote, case, and buttons. </t>  <t> The interface specialist presents the interface concept by explaining the difference between graphical and command interface. </t>  <t> They decide the command interface is most useful for a remote because it is simpler and more user-friendly. </t>  <t> The group discusses aspects of the user interface including the lighting up effect and material of the buttons. </t>  <t> The marketing expert presents on trend-watching and talks about how fruit and vegetables are an important fashion theme this year, and says the material used is expected to be spongy. </t>  <t> The group discusses how they could implement these fashion trends into the design, then finalizes a few decisions about the components, materials, and energy sources. </t>  <t> The project manager closes the meeting, stating what each member's next task will be. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will work on the look-and-feel design. </t>  <t> The interface designer will work on the user interface design. </t>  <t> The industrial and interface designers will be working together using modelling clay. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will be evaluating the product. </t>  <t> Their personal coaches will give the rest of the information </t>  <t> Command interface is the best for a remote, so it will be used. </t>  <t> Control will light up when you touch a button. </t>  <t> Will use personal face places. </t>  <t> The remote will run on kinetic energy. </t>  <t> Push buttons will be used. </t>  <t> Regular chip will be used. </t>  <t> Case will be plastic and coated in rubber. </t>  <t> Functions will be basic, including power, channels, volume. </t>  <t> The group would like to use a fruit and vegetable theme but are not yet sure how to implement it into their product. </t>  <t> The group was uncertain whether to add audio, because they would have to make it compatible with TVs on an international scale. </t>  <t> They decide to eliminate it and make simplicity their sales pitch. </t> 
<t> The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. </t>  <t> The designers give the prototype presentation, showing their simple design that is based on a mango. </t>  <t> They point out the company logo and LED, and demonstrate how the device is palm-held and thumb-acessible. </t>  <t> They also discuss the numerical, volume, channel, and power buttons as well as the color scheme. </t>  <t> The marketing expert administers the product evaluation, and they rate each of the ten criteria on a scale of 1-7. </t>  <t> The criteria includes fancy look-and-feel, technological innovation, ease of use, look, whether people would be willing to spend 25 Euros for it, whether its operating behavior matches the average user, ease of finding when lost, ease of learning to use, whether it will minimize RSI, incorporation of company colors and logo, and whether it follows the motto. </t>  <t> They average the scores and get 1.9. </t>  <t> They check the product costing and find that their operating cost is 12.20 Euros. </t>  <t> In evaluating the project process they are pleased with their creativity, leadership, timing, teamwork, discussions, and overall product given the resources they had. </t>  <t> They close the meeting by thanking one another. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> Numbers have a circular design. </t>  <t> Casing will be interchangable and color schemes will be named and colored after fruits and vegetables. </t>  <t> Will be two colors, one for case and one for buttons. </t>  <t> Will use a regular chip. </t>  <t> The remote will be double-curved. </t>  <t> Will be made of plastic and rubber (rubber on remote for comfort). </t>  <t> Product costing is 1.20 Euros. </t>  <t> *NA*. </t> 
<t> The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves and describe their roles in the upcoming project. </t>  <t> The project manager then described the upcoming project. </t>  <t> The team then discussed their experiences with remote controls. </t>  <t> They also discussed the project budget and which features they would like to see in the remote control they are to create. </t>  <t> The team discussed universal usage, how to find remotes when misplaced, shapes and colors, ball shaped remotes, marketing strategies, keyboards on remotes, and remote sizes. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will find out what the most universally appealing remote control on the market is. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will research user preferences </t>  <t> The remote will sell for 25 Euro. </t>  <t> The team will not create a ball shaped remote. </t>  <t> The stability of a ball shaped remote. </t>  <t> Having hinges on a ball shaped remote. </t>  <t> What shape the remote should be. </t> 
<t> The project manager recapped the events and decisions of the previous meeting. </t>  <t> The marketing expert presented research on user preferences and tendencies with remote controls. </t>  <t> The research indicated that users want remotes to be more attractive, to match the behavior of the user, to be easier to locate when misplaced, and not to cause RSI. </t>  <t> The research also indicated that younger users were interested speech recognition. </t>  <t> The user interface designer spoke on the option to have a universal remote, presented two differently designed remotes available on the market, and described some features a user-centered remote should include. </t>  <t> The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and then the team discussed the option to include speech recognition in their design. </t>  <t> The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to abide by. </t>  <t> The team then discussed the option to include a recharger with a locater button in their design, the appearance of their remote, buttons, how to make an ergonomic remote, and the option to have a two-piece remote. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will work on components. </t>  <t> The team will explore the option of a two-piece remote. </t>  <t> The user interface designer will explore how well a rounded, ergonomic remote and a two-piece remote work with the user. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will examine trend watching reports </t>  <t> The remote will only be used for televisions. </t>  <t> The team will not work with teletext. </t>  <t> The corporate color and slogan must be incorporated into the design. </t>  <t> The remote will be simple. </t>  <t> The remote will look appealing. </t>  <t> The remote will be easy to find. </t>  <t> The remote will have a minimal number of buttons. </t>  <t> The remote will be yellow with black or gray buttons. </t>  <t> The corporate slogan will appear on the bottom of the remote. </t>  <t> The remote will have buttons for numbers, volume up and down, channel up and down, power, mute, and a menu. </t>  <t> The remote will include a scroll action. </t>  <t> The remote will be rounded in shape such that it fits comfortably in the hand. </t>  <t> The reliability of speech recognition. </t>  <t> Whether to include speech recognition. </t>  <t> How to accommodate left-handed people with an ergonomic design that fits right-handed people. </t> 
<t> The project manager reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting. </t>  <t> The marketing expert discussed the results of trend watching reports which indicated a need for products which have a fancy look and feel, are technologically innovative, easy to use, include a fruit and vegetable theme, and are spongy in feel. </t>  <t> The marketing expert stressed the need to incorporate these findings into the team's design and suggested that the team should create a remote that has limited buttons , can be personalized, and is not rectangular. </t>  <t> The user interface designer briefly described how speech recognition technology works and what ways a user can use a remote. </t>  <t> The user interface designer presented three existing products on the market - a voice recognition remote, an iPod, and a children's remote - and discussed a few features to include in the team's design. </t>  <t> The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the restrictions involved in combining various components, energy sources, and materials. </t>  <t> The industrial designer also discussed with the how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into their design. </t>  <t> The team then discussed and decided what components, materials, and energy sources to use. </t>  <t> The user interface designer will work on the user interface design. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will work on the look and feel design. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will work on a product evaluation. </t>  <t> The user interface designer and industrial designer will work on a prototype </t>  <t> The remote will use conventional batteries. </t>  <t> The case will be made of plastic with rubber grips. </t>  <t> The remote will feature a scroll function similar to the scroll function found on iPods. </t>  <t> The remote will use a more expensive, advanced chip-on-print. </t>  <t> How to have a curved remote made with rubber. </t>  <t> How to include a fruit and vegetable theme. </t>  <t> What sort of chip to use. </t>  <t> Whether to use plastic or rubber. </t> 
<t> The project manager opened the meeting and read the minutes of the previous meeting. </t>  <t> The industrial designer and user interface designer presented the prototype they created, which was designed to look like a banana. </t>  <t> The marketing expert conducted an evaluation of the prototype. </t>  <t> The team found that, although the overall design of the prototype was attractive, its yellow color was ugly. </t>  <t> The team rated the prototype highly on its ease of use and felt that its yellow color and shape detracted slightly from its ability to be misplaced and that a feature which causes the remote to make noise based on its proximity to a television needed to be added. </t>  <t> The team thought the prototype was fashionable and not technologically innovative or spongy. </t>  <t> The project manager led the team in calculating the production costs of the remote and ensuring that they aligned with the project budget. </t>  <t> The costs were over budget, so the team opted to exclude the LCD from their design to meet their budget. </t>  <t> The team conducted an evaluation of the project process and found that they performed well and were somewhat satisfied by the resources available to them. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> The remote will make some sort of noise based on its proximity to a television. </t>  <t> The remote will use two batteries. </t>  <t> The remote will use an advanced chip-on-print. </t>  <t> The remote will be double curved. </t>  <t> The remote case will be made of plastic. </t>  <t> The remote will come in a special color. </t>  <t> The remote will not use an LCD. </t>  <t> What feature to include to prevent the remote from getting lost. </t>  <t> What sort of button supplements the remote requires. </t>  <t> How to meet the project budget. </t> 
<t> The meeting begins with the group trying to resolve some equipment issues and waiting for Anna's arrival. </t>  <t> Then the project manager introduces the meeting by saying they have some technical tools with which to communicate so they will try to get acquainted with them first. </t>  <t> He starts talking about the product they are to design, a remote control which should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. </t>  <t> The general outline of the project will be the functional, conceptual, and detailed design. </t>  <t> They do some tool training by trying out the whiteboard, and each person draws his/her favorite animal on it. </t>  <t> The project manager proceeds to talk about the project finance, which is followed by a group discussion about what functions a good remote control has. </t>  <t> This includes the basics such as on/off, channel up/down browsing, volume and record button(s). </t>  <t> At this point they clarify their names and roles in the group and then resume talking about remote control functions. </t>  <t> They discuss some functions such as a personal video recorder, but say it is probable that they cannot produce a fancy device given their budget. </t>  <t> The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what he/she will be working on. </t>  <t> The interface designer will work on a general design. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will work on the technica function design. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will think about user requirements. </t>  <t> The selling price of the product will be about twenty five Euros each. </t>  <t> The production cost will be twelve Euros and fifty cents. </t>  <t> The profit will be about fifty million Euro. </t>  <t> -The remote will target an international market. </t>  <t> The remote will be for use with the television set. </t>  <t> The necessary buttons are on/off, channel up/down browsing, volume, and record button(s). </t>  <t> They have not decided what functions the remote can have, but they have discussed that they may not be able to produce something extremely fancy with the given budget. </t>  <t> They will need to examine user requirements before deciding on what functionalities are necessary. </t> 
<t> The project manager opens the meeting and presents the agenda using slides. </t>  <t> The marketing expert explains the research she read about, which is a study done on 100 people asking their remote usage habits and preferences. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer presents, explaining the basic function of a remote control and how it works. </t>  <t> He says they should first agree on the technical functions before he creates working design and chooses the chips and infrared components to build it. </t>  <t> The Interface Designer gives his presentation, talking about the remote's technical function of sending a message to the TV set that is decoded by the TV. </t>  <t> Standard TV remotes have an on/off button, play, volume change, number keypad, and a 1 or 2 digit option. </t>  <t> He suggests that in aiming for the next generation they should have a remote for the TV and video integrated together. </t>  <t> The project manager recieves a message from account manager, which he shares with the group. </t>  <t> They discuss and determine the target group as well as the possibility of making a universal remote for stereo, VCR, and TV. </t>  <t> They close the meeting with the project manager telling each group member what they will do before the next meeting. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will try to find out which components are needed. </t>  <t> The interface designer will get more specific user interface content. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will look at what trends are in this type of market </t>  <t> They will target the 20-40 age group. </t>  <t> Teletext is a well known feature of televisions but is no longer in frequent use because of the internet, will not be used. </t>  <t> The remote should be trendy as possible but still have a reliable image so that it does not appear poorly-functional. </t>  <t> The group is interested in creating a universal remote, however they are unable to deterine what components are needed without looking at the standards and current trends in the market. </t>  <t> One group member brought up that it is not possible to make a universal high-performance remote with the given budget. </t>  <t> More research is necessary to determine this. </t> 
<t> Then the project manager opens the meeting announcing that they will address conceptual design and then giving the agenda. </t>  <t> Matthew arrives late and the marketing expert begins her presentation about trends. </t>  <t> She emphasizes that the remote needs to be exciting, contain a cool feature, and be somewhat intuitive. </t>  <t> She reports that currently fruits and vegetables are fashionable- thus bright eye-catching colors, bold designs, and a spongy feel is appropriate. </t>  <t> She lists ideas such as changable covers, a locator, speech recognition, and LCD screens. </t>  <t> The industrial specialist presents, talking about how a remote typically has different keys, structures and forms. </t>  <t> He likes the idea of implenting speech recognition into a universal remote. </t>  <t> They discuss without certainity about the cost of such functions. </t>  <t> The industrial designer presents about remote control components and the manufacturing process, listing options such as various buttons, scroll wheels, integrated push buttons like those in a computer mouse, and LCDs.  They discuss the project budget and the possibility of using an expensive chip. </t>  <t> They decide to make two designs, one more advanced than the other. </t>  <t> The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what his/her tasks will be until the next meeting. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will look for the cost inventories of other devices, such as speech recognition. </t>  <t> She will also start evaluating the team's work if possible. </t>  <t> The industial and interface designer will work together on the two prototypes (one cost-effective and one higher-end). </t>  <t> They will recieve further instructions by email. </t>  <t> They decide that the keys on the remote should be smooth, big, and there should not be too many. </t>  <t> They are not certain if the project budget will allow them to use the more expensive chip, so they decided to make two prototypes so that they can compare them and possibly find a compromise. </t> 
<t> As the meeting opens the project manager tells the group that they must stay within the budget of twelve Euro and fifty cents or will have to redesign. </t>  <t> After Matthew arrives the designers begin presenting the two prototypes, beginning with the basic conventional one which is shaped like a surfboard and costs 7 or 8 Euros to produce. </t>  <t> It contains an on-off button, volume switch, up/down channel function, 10 digits, and two extra buttons for teletext and an additional function. </t>  <t> The next control is futuristic because feels like a mobile phone, has 6 keys, and is smooth. </t>  <t> It also has a power button, channel up/down, slow pause/slow stop, LCD screen, toggle switch that changes it from audio to video, and microphone. </t>  <t> It would cost 16 Euros to produce, which is out of the budget. </t>  <t> The marketing expert gives the product evaluation and they rate them on look and feel, innovation, ease of use, appeal to the correct demographic, and adherence to the company motto and fashion trends. </t>  <t> They discuss the energy source, shape, chip type, LCD and speech recognition, and additional buttons. </t>  <t> After choosing features their remote costs 12 Euros to produce. </t>  <t> They close the meeting by thanking one another. </t>  <t> NA. </t>  <t> The remote will be double-curved. </t>  <t> The energy source will be a normal AA battery. </t>  <t> Shaped like a surfboard. </t>  <t> Made of plastic. </t>  <t> Will contain a regular chip. </t>  <t> Have no LCD screen or speech recognition. </t>  <t> Addition of two buttons. </t>  <t> Production cost 12 Euros, 50 cents cheaper than budget. </t>  <t> Will talk to the suppliers to see if they can lower prices and add a few more features. </t>  <t> The group created two design prototypes to choose from. </t>  <t> When they rated both products, they found that the basic version was not innovative enough but the advanced version was too costly. </t>  <t> They eliminated many of the features of the advanced version, eventually bringing them near to the basic. </t>  <t> It was a long and tedious process, taking much time for them to reach an agreement since some felt an LCD screen was necessary and others did not. </t> 
<t> The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave a timeline for the project. </t>  <t> The group trained themselves to use the meeting room tools by drawing on the whiteboard. </t>  <t> The Project Manager presented the project budget and the projected price point and profit goals. </t>  <t> The group discussed several of their initial ideas for the features of the product. </t>  <t> They discussed making the remote able to control multiple devices, protection from water or from dropping the remote, and a locator function. </t>  <t> The Project Manager then instructed the User Interface Designer to research users' requirements, and instructed the Industrial and User Interface Designers to research the functions and usability features that were discussed in the meeting. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer will do research on the whistle tracking locator function and other functional components. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer will research the necessary amount of buttons and the lighted interface that were discussed during the meeting and other usability features. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert will research users' requirements for a remote control device. </t>  <t> The group would like the remote to control multiple devices and have optional water and other damage protection. </t>  <t> The group will research the possibility of integrating a locator function into the design. </t>  <t> NA. </t> 
<t> The User Interface Designer presented the major components of the interface design, dividing the interface into two parts: voice commands and buttons. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert went over users' requirements as seen in a company study and showed that the major complaint was that remotes were too difficult to use. </t>  <t> She also showed that users want fancier and more ergonomic designs, shock protection, voice recognition, and LCD screens. </t>  <t> The Project Manager announced a new requirement to the group, that the remote is only to control televisions. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer gave a layout of the internal functions of the device and showed that a standard chip, instead of a larger one that would accomodate voice recognition, would be the most feasible. </t>  <t> The Project Manager announced also that the group was not to include a teletext function and that they should integrate the company logo into the external design. </t>  <t> The group decided on what button functions should be included and decided to eliminate the LCD screen and voice recognition from the design due to time and cost restraints. </t>  <t> The group decided to include a previous channel change button to the standard remote buttons, and to have a wheel for changing channels in increments, with a smaller number pad below it. </t>  <t> The remote will not have an LCD screen. </t>  <t> The remote will not include speech recognition. </t>  <t> The group experienced many technical difficulties with their presentations; all participants encountered problems when opening their presentations. </t> 
<t> The Industrial Designer presented the functional components that will appear in the prototype, and discussed with the group the high cost of the wheel sensor and the possibility of incorporating speech recognition. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer presented existing remote controls to help show the interface of the prototype. </t>  <t> He showed how the new design will be more simple and ergonomic than the models he displayed by eliminating extra functions. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert presented news about trends in fashion and in the market that will be incorporated into the design. </t>  <t> A fruit and vegetable theme and spongy materials are popular trends that will be used in the design. </t>  <t> The group finalized which features they wanted to integrate into the design. </t>  <t> They decided to make the remote shaped like a banana and spongy, to have the buttons lighted, to have a wheel sensor at the top of the device, and to use only a standard chip and battery that would not accomodate speech recognition. </t>  <t> The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype, and announced that the prototype would be evaluated in the next meeting. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer will construct a prototype for the product. </t>  <t> The group will evaluate the prototype according to whether or not it meets the requirements of users. </t>  <t> The group decided on the features that will be incorporated into the design of the prototype. </t>  <t> The remote will be shaped and colored like a banana, and be covered in a spongy material. </t>  <t> The buttons will be lighted. </t>  <t> The group decided to keep the wheel sensor despite the added cost. </t>  <t> It will be placed at the top of the banana shape. </t>  <t> The group decided to simply use a standard chip that will not accomodate speech recognition, as this feature will be eliminated from the functional design. </t>  <t> The remote will use standard batteries. </t>  <t> NA. </t> 
<t> The Project Manager presented the final cost of the remote with the finalized list of components. </t>  <t> The final cost was under the alotted budget; the Project Manager announced that the project could then continue with the current prototype. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert presented an evaluation of the prototype to the group. </t>  <t> The group evaluated the prototype based on the requirements of users presented in the first meetings. </t>  <t> The group decided that the prototype met enough of these goals to be able to market the product. </t>  <t> The prototype was presented and the group discussed the look of the prototype. </t>  <t> The Project Manager summarized the accomplishments of the meeting. </t>  <t> The group decided that the final cost of the prototype was low enough that they could continue with the current prototype and still meet the profit goals. </t>  <t> The group also decided that the design of the prototype was satisfactory and met enough of the users' requirements to be able to be marketed. </t>  <t> NA. </t> 
<t> The Project Manager reviewed new requirements for the project with the group and discussed their implementation. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer presented the basic components of a remote control device and how they work together. </t>  <t> He showed that the size of the chip they will use is dependent on how many complicated functions are included. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer stressed that the project should focus on a simple design for the device. </t>  <t> The group discussed not being able to include a teletext component, and that the product design would have to be the main selling point of the device. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert discussed his marketing strategy for the project, again stressing the attractiveness of the product design. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer proposed including a battery charging stand with the device but it was decided that it was not a useful feature. </t>  <t> The group continued to discuss the marketing strategy for the device as it would not include many advanced technological functions; they discussed including a guarantee for the remote and using a unique form factor. </t>  <t> The group decided that they want to incorporate teletext despite the management's directive. </t>  <t> The group does not want to include the battery charging stand. </t>  <t> There was a lack of information about the cost of components and materials. </t>  <t> The group felt constrained by the new project requirements and had difficulties implementing the management's directives. </t> 
<t> The Industrial Designer presented an overview of the internal components of a remote control device. </t>  <t> He discussed energy source and material options, and suggested that using rubber and plastic would be the most versatile option. </t>  <t> He displayed the three options for chips. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer discussed voice recognition with the group, and the group decided to not use it in their design. </t>  <t> He suggested using rubber buttons because of their durability. </t>  <t> He discussed the size of the device and the layout of the interface, and suggested that the remote be moderately sized to prevent its getting lost. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert expressed concern that the remote lacked enough features to be distinctive. </t>  <t> The group had a discussion to decide on the product features. </t>  <t> They decided to include a charging stand, to use a thin rubber casing material, to include a locator function and a scroll wheel with two channel-changing options to increase its usability. </t>  <t> The group discussed the cost of the various components and decided to sell the device at a point between thirty-five and fifty Euros. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to construct the prototype. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will construct the prototype. </t>  <t> The remote will not feature voice recognition. </t>  <t> The group decided to include a charging stand to help users keep track of their remote. </t>  <t> A locator function will also be included. </t>  <t> The device will be covered in a thin rubber casing. </t>  <t> A scroll wheel will be included for the channel-changing function, and will allow users to switch between scrolling through pre-programmed favorite channels and through all channels. </t>  <t> The projected price point will be changed to a point between thirty-five and fifty Euros. </t>  <t> The remote will feature back-lit buttons. </t>  <t> There was a lack of information on the cost of components. </t>  <t> The group had difficulty finding a balance between keeping the project cost low and adding enough features to make the product distinctive. </t> 
<t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype to the group and displayed all of its components. </t>  <t> They demonstrated how the locator function operates. </t>  <t> They suggested that a trigger button should be included in a later designing phase to improve the feel of the product. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the product and felt that it satisfied his criteria. </t>  <t> He suggested including a lifetime guarantee and expressed concern that the remote would only be used for televisions. </t>  <t> The Project Manager discussed the final production cost with the group; after an analysis of all of the components the final cost was 15.8 Euros. </t>  <t> The Project Manager then led a discussion about the group's experience on the project. </t>  <t> The group felt that they worked well together and that they had room to be creative, but only after they changed many of the initial specifications. </t>  <t> They also had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment. </t>  <t> They were satisfied with the increased final cost and budget. </t>  <t> The group was satisfied enough with the prototype and the final production cost to continue with the current prototype. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert was still concerned that the remote would only be used for televisions. </t>  <t> The group felt that they had room to be creative, but only after they changed the initial specifications. </t>  <t> The group had difficulties with their computers and much of the meeting-room equipment. </t> 
<t> The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and discussed the roles of each member and the selling price for the remote they will produce. </t>  <t> Then the team participated in an exercise in which they all drew animals. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> The remote will have international appeal. </t>  <t> The remote will not be too expensive. </t>  <t> The remote will have new functions that existing remotes do not have. </t>  <t> The difference between the role of the industrial designer and the role of the user interface designer. </t> 
<t> The User Interface Designer discussed  some characteristics and functions to consider in designing the remote and introduced an idea for giving the remote international appeal by merging it with a system such as Google. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and presented options for components and materials which would keep costs low. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert presented consumer preferences and requirements. </t>  <t> The project manager introduced the new requirements for the project. </t>  <t> The team then discussed different features they could include in the design of the remote. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer will conduct further research into components. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer will work on the interface concept </t>  <t> The remote should look fancy. </t>  <t> The remote should not have too many buttons. </t>  <t> Teletext will not be used. </t>  <t> The remote will only be used for televisions. </t>  <t> The corporate logo should be recognizable on the product. </t>  <t> The corporate color must be featured on the product. </t>  <t> The remote has to be fashionable. </t>  <t> Whether to have a wireless remote or one which is linked by a cable to the television. </t>  <t> How to have a highly functional and powerful remote while minimizing the number of buttons. </t>  <t> What colors the remote should come in. </t> 
<t> The User Interface Designer presented three different concepts to consider for the user interface and introduced the idea of using speech recognition in the design of the remote. </t>  <t> The team discussed the issue of using speech recognition at length. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer presented possible materials to use in making the case for the remote, introduced the option of using a solar battery, and discussed options for buttons. </t>  <t> The Marketing Specialist  discussed recent findings from trend watching reports. </t>  <t> The team discussed what materials to use and their interface concept. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer will work on the look and feel of the design, the ease of use of the design, the characteristics of being powerful and fancy, and the speech recognition aspect. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer will work on adding a spongy quality to the buttons and the shape of the remote. </t>  <t> Two members of the team will work on creating a prototype made of clay </t>  <t> The team will not use the intelligent controller proposed by the User Interface Designer. </t>  <t> The remote will be technologically innovative. </t>  <t> The team will mix the concepts of the Google controller and the fancy controller in their design. </t>  <t> The remote will use solar energy. </t>  <t> The remote will use low level chips. </t>  <t> The case of the remote will be made of wood. </t>  <t> The remote will have LCD buttons. </t>  <t> The remote will use speech recognition for simple commands. </t>  <t> Using speech recognition in the remote. </t>  <t> Whether to have a case that is made of wood or is spongy. </t> 
<t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototype for the remote. </t>  <t> The prototype was yellow and red and was shaped like a mushroom. </t>  <t> The team then conducted a product evaluation of the prototype. </t>  <t> Overall, the team found the prototype to be technologically innovative but had some issues with the prototype's appearance and its usability. </t>  <t> The team decided that the prototype required further work. </t>  <t> The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. </t>  <t> In discussing the production costs, the team settled on what features they wanted in the remote, while staying within the boundaries of their budget, and decided it was not necessary to completely redesign their product. </t>  <t> The team then engaged in a project evaluation in which the team discussed the process of creating their product. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> The remote will be shaped like a pineapple. </t>  <t> The remote will be made of plastic. </t>  <t> The case of the remote will be single curved. </t>  <t> The remote will have one solar cell. </t>  <t> The remote will have a scroll wheel. </t>  <t> The remote will feature only one push button. </t>  <t> The corporate logo will need to be incorporated into the product. </t>  <t> Whether to use a mushroom or another fruit or vegetable as the basis of the shape of the remote. </t>  <t> Having a base on the remote which the user is required to turn in a circular motion in order to change the channel. </t> 
<t> The project manager Sebastian opens the meeting. </t>  <t> The rest introduce themselves, including Michael the interface designer, Guillermo the marketing expert, and Hemant the industrial designer. </t>  <t> The project manager states the goal of the project, which is to develop a new remote control. </t>  <t> It should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. </t>  <t> He also mentions the three-step project- functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design. </t>  <t> Then they take turns drawing their favorite animal on the white board. </t>  <t> After that they briefly discuss finances. </t>  <t> The remote control's target selling price of twenty-five Euro dollars and will be for the international market. </t>  <t> They need to generate a profit of fifty million Euros. </t>  <t> The question of whether the remote control should be for a specific device was brought up but not answered. </t>  <t> The project manager closes the meeting, telling each group member what he is responsible for and reminding them that they will receive more information by email. </t>  <t> The project manager designates each group member's task- working on the working design, technical functions, or user requirement specs. </t>  <t> They will receive more information by email. </t>  <t> The project goal is to develop a new remote control. </t>  <t> The target selling price will be 25 Euro dollars. </t>  <t> They will target the international market. </t>  <t> They will generate a proft of fifty million Euros. </t>  <t> A group member asks whether it is going to be a stand-alone unit, or one that requires a T.V. beforehand. </t>  <t> They did not decide yet what type of remote control to produce- whether it should be for a specific device or universal. </t>  <t> The main concern is that they do not know what the product is, yet they have to make it fit that price bracket. </t> 
<t> The project manager opens the meeting stating that they will address the functional design of the remote and saying they are still undecided about whether it should be universal or specific. </t>  <t> He suggests they name the project and they come up with "mando", meaning "control" in Spanish. </t>  <t> The marketing expert presents some research done on user opinions of remotes. </t>  <t> He suggests the use of using voice recognition or an LCD, which they discuss despite concerns about budget limitation. </t>  <t> The industrial designer presents, showing examples of existing products and suggesting they add a scroll wheel for channel-changing. </t>  <t> He says Internet capability might be necessary for an LCD and then brings up button size, suggesting having a flip-open door with extra buttons under it. </t>  <t> They discuss voice recognition again, and then the interface specialist presents. </t>  <t> He suggests they have two types of user interfaces and brings up that voice recognition would increase production price. </t>  <t> They talk about the budget limitations on features and then the project manager summarizes decisios made and closes the meeting by teeling each group member what he should work on. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will work on the component concept. </t>  <t> The interface specialist will work on the user interface. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will work on trend-watching. </t>  <t> The remote control will be for television only. </t>  <t> The remote control should be fancy, a good shape, and not too small or too big. </t>  <t> To target towards young people will bring in new technology. </t>  <t> A wheel should be used to navigate. </t>  <t> Because of budget restrictions, they cannot do speech recognition technologies. </t>  <t> Corporate logo will be clearly displayed on product. </t>  <t> They have not yet decided whether to include an LCD screen. </t>  <t> Although the project manager clearly does not favor the idea because of budget costs and the possible requirement of internet connection, others are pushing for it. </t>  <t> They find that the budget is restricting their capabilities, and mentioned increasing the price of the remote control. </t> 
<t> The project manager opens the meeting, stating that it is about conceptual design. </t>  <t> He restates the last meeting's descision that they will not do speech recognition technology but says they still have to decide whether to use an LCD screen. </t>  <t> Then they move on to the three presentations. </t>  <t> The marketing expert is first to present, and he talks about making a pleasant-looking device, particularly one that favors current trends. </t>  <t> They then begin talking about using a fruit, vegetable, or natural object as the shape of the remote, the logo, or for the buttons. </t>  <t> Eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana. </t>  <t> Next, the user interface specialist presents. </t>  <t> He annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit, which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control. </t>  <t> They have the option of using that technology. </t>  <t> He shows them his plan what the remote control could look like and the features it might have. </t>  <t> He suggests putting two scroll wheels- one for changing the channel and another for the volume. </t>  <t> He also included a turbo button for speed, which he thinks every design should have. </t>  <t> Since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the LCD screen idea. </t>  <t> After that the interface specialist talks about having a base station for the purpose of finding the remote control when lost. </t>  <t> The user could simply press a button on the base station and the remote control would start beeping. </t>  <t> Lastly, the industrial designer presents, discussing the power source of the remote control. </t>  <t> He suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good. </t>  <t> He talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell, which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design. </t>  <t> Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum. </t>  <t> In addition, he talks about giving the control a double curve, curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle. </t>  <t> They do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape, and one group member feels that the shape is not handy. </t>  <t> The industrial desiger tells them they will use a regular chip rather than the advanced one since pricing is a factor. </t>  <t> They agree on having base station with the remote. </t>  <t> They go on to have discussion, with one member suggesting that they make the banana more stylized so that it looks less like a banana- for example, it could be silver. </t>  <t> After that the project manager has them discuss/reiterate the decisions made during the meeting:  no LCD screen, the remote will have a base station, a RF for beeping, a button on the base station to press, possibly a stylish banana-shape for the control, 2 scroll wheels to control the volume and channels at the thumb level, a turbo button perhaps underneath the device, on/off button for the TV. </t>  <t> Before the next meeting, the interface specialist and industrial designer have to work together on the user interface and the look/feel design. </t>  <t> The marketing expert has to look up product evaluation. </t>  <t> Thus far, LCD and ASR have been ruled out. </t>  <t> The remote will have a base station, a button on the base station to press, 2 scroll wheels for the channels and volume, a turbo button (possibly underneath the device), and an on/off button for the TV. </t>  <t> The group has not yet agreed on whether the remote should be banana-shaped. </t>  <t> There is concern that the shape is not handy and might make the product less marketable- that would be a problem since they have to meet the fifty million euros profit goal. </t> 
<t> The project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting. </t>  <t> They have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design, features, and power source, type of chip and weight of the remote. </t>  <t> They go through the evaulations, using the a list of criteria made by the marketing expert. </t>  <t> They rate each criteria on a scale of 0 (true) to 7 (false): how fancy it is, how handy it is, how functional, how cool it is, whether they would spend twenty five euro for it, and whether they would change their current remote for this one. </t>  <t> Next they do a cost estimate for production. </t>  <t> In doing this, they decide against solar cells and go with the rechargable batteries. </t>  <t> They keep the regular chip, stick with plastic, put two scroll wheels and three push buttons, and make it a special shade of yellow. </t>  <t> They eliminate the turbo button and give the remote a single curve because of budget restrictions. </t>  <t> They briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> It will be shaped like a banana, with an base station resembling a banana leaf for it to sit on. </t>  <t> The volume scroll wheel will be on the left, channel scroll on the right. </t>  <t> Will contain a teletext button, when pressed teletext appears and channel selector can be used to navigate through the teletext. </t>  <t> Infared port on top of banana as well as bottom front of base station. </t>  <t> The control will be the approx. </t>  <t> Weight of an actual banana but a special shade of yellow. </t>  <t> Will be made of plastic. </t>  <t> Three push buttons. </t>  <t> For pricing reasons eliminate solar cells - use rechargable batteries as power source, base station used for battery-charging which should last 8-10 hours depending on frequency of use. </t>  <t> For pricing reasons they will use a regular chip for the control rather than advanced one. </t>  <t> For pricing reasons the remote will have a single, not double curve. </t>  <t> For pricing reasons they eliminate the turbo button. </t>  <t> For pricing reasons they had to use a regular chip instead of advanced, single curve instead of double, rechargable batteries instead of solar cells, and eliminate the turbo button. </t> 
<t> The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves by name and their role in the project. </t>  <t> The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then had the team members participate in a tool training exercise in which each member drew his favorite animal on the white board and discussed what he liked about the animal. </t>  <t> The project manager also discussed selling prices and the project budget. </t>  <t> The team then discussed their experiences with remotes, focusing on various features they would like to see in the remote they will produce, as well as features they find unappealing in current remotes. </t>  <t> The interface designer will work on the technical functions of the remote. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will find the user requirements for the remote </t>  <t> The remote will sell for 25 Euro. </t>  <t> The remote will be sold internationally. </t>  <t> The production costs cannot exceed 12.50 Euro. </t>  <t> *NA*. </t> 
<t> The project manager opened the meeting and then the marketing expert discussed user requirements. </t>  <t> The marketing expert also found that younger users want an LCD display and a remote capable of speech recognition. </t>  <t> The interface specialist discussed the interior workings of a remote and stated a preference for using radio waves over infra-red technology. </t>  <t> The industrial designer discussed particular components that a remote could include. </t>  <t> The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and initiated a discussion in which the team discussed and decided on various features to include in the remote they will produce. </t>  <t> The team members will work on their individual work </t>  <t> The team will not work with teletext. </t>  <t> The remote will only be used for televisions. </t>  <t> The corporate image must be recognizable in the product. </t>  <t> The remote will have buttons for channel changing, volume settings, numerals, and power on/off. </t>  <t> The remote will feature an LCD screen. </t>  <t> Lesser used functions will be able to be accessed on the remote but they will be hidden on the remote. </t>  <t> The remote will not have a time button. </t>  <t> Cost of adding speech recognition to a remote. </t>  <t> Whether using radio waves will interfere with other technology a user owns. </t>  <t> Cost of infra-red components. </t>  <t> How to minimize the number of buttons on the remote while having buttons to access channels. </t>  <t> Whether to include lesser used functions in the remote. </t>  <t> Whether to have a power button. </t>  <t> Whether to have a timer feature. </t>  <t> Whether to have a display function. </t>

<t> This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype. </t>  <t> It has on-off and volume buttons, an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours, which largely replaces the use of push buttons, and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD. </t>  <t> It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface, which also serves as mechanism for locating the device. </t>  <t> It was designed to be powered by a single battery. </t>  <t> The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion. </t>  <t> The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype, although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive. </t>  <t> Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> After the team realised the prototype was over budget, they replaced the battery with a hand dynamo. </t>  <t> When it became evident from the costs of components and materials that they would have to do without either the LCD or the speech recognition, they decided to change the given prices in order to accommodate them to their design and budget. </t>  <t> The gratuitous presence of decorative rubber strawberries on a titanium case (even if they cover sensors) did not meet everyone's approval. </t>  <t> Although, the attempt was towards keeping with the current fashion trends, the result did not satisfy the program manager. </t>  <t> The prototype was more than 40% over budget. </t>  <t> The team realised that their budget did not allow for all the specifications of their prototype. </t> 
<t> The Project Manager introduced the project to the group. </t>  <t> The group set an agenda for the meeting and discussed the materials sent to them by the Account Manager. </t>  <t> They discussed and explained their roles in the project. </t>  <t> The group began a discussion about their initial ideas for the product. </t>  <t> They discussed several usability features: adding speech recognition and an option to choose what to watch by channel or by content, reducing the number of buttons by using the television screen to display options, and adding a light adaptation system. </t>  <t> All participants were instructed to gather more information for the next meeting, the functional design meeting. </t>  <t> All participants were instructed to gather information for the functional design meeting. </t>  <t> The group decided to include an option for the user to choose what to watch by channel or by content or program type. </t>  <t> The project agenda and the participant roles were not clear to all participants at the beginning of the meeting. </t>  <t> The group could not decide if they wanted to include speech recognition in the design. </t> 
<t> The Project Manager presented the goals of the meeting and new product requirements. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of a remote control and showed a diagram of how they operate together. </t>  <t> He suggested that field programmable gateway arrays be used for the chip controlling software functionalities, and it was suggested that the remote be used with a recharging stand. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on the technical functions of the remote, and displayed the interfaces of two existing products for comparison. </t>  <t> He showed that the competitors' remotes were too complicated. </t>  <t> He suggested that the televisions that the remotes are used with connect to the internet to access downloadable programs. </t>  <t> He suggested a simple design with few buttons, small size, and a locator function. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert presented several characteristics important to users. </t>  <t> He discussed using speech recognition and ways to make it feasible for the project, small size, low price point, and incorporating teletext in different languages. </t>  <t> The group discussed the new requirement that required them to omit teletext from their design, and discussed the possibility of using the remote to access the internet through the television. </t>  <t> The remote will be used with a recharging stand. </t>  <t> The group decided not to include a lighting adaptation system. </t>  <t> The participants disagreed on how to easily move through channels using the design of the User Interface Designer, which included very few buttons. </t>  <t> There was no resolution on whether or not to allow users to use the remote to access the internet through their television, as opposed to including teletext capabilities. </t> 
<t> The Industrial Designer presented options for each component. </t>  <t> He suggested kinetic energy, a titanium case, and rubber push buttons. </t>  <t> The group will ask if the kinetic energy component can provide enough energy. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer introduced the graphical user interface to the group and suggested using an LCD screen. </t>  <t> He presented several existing products and suggested the following: large buttons; voice recognition; either push, scroll, or spinning buttons; and incorporating some customizable components. </t>  <t> The group discussed including a help button; it was decided that it would make the device seem more complicated. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert presented that users found remotes too easily lost, complicated, and ugly. </t>  <t> He showed that users were willing to pay more for a fancy remote. </t>  <t> He suggested the LCD screen; the group felt that it was better to utilize the user's television as a display screen, but that they would inquire about cost before deciding. </t>  <t> The group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and scroll buttons. </t>  <t> The group discussed incorporating a locator function and customization for children. </t>  <t> They discussed the sensitivity of the voice recognizer to other noises; the group will ask about the capability of the recognizer. </t>  <t> The group will find out if the kinetic energy component can provide enough energy. </t>  <t> The group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and the scroll button. </t>  <t> The group will ask about the capability of the voice recognition component. </t>  <t> The group decided not to include a help button on the device because it would make the remote seem more complicated. </t>  <t> There was not enough information about the capabilities of the voice recognizer or the kinetic energy source. </t>  <t> There was not enough information on the cost of several components. </t>  <t> No decision was made about whether or not the LCD screen should be included. </t>  <t> No decision was made about including a locator function, or what form it should take. </t>  <t> No decision was made about making the remote programmable for children. </t> 
<t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented two prototypes, one with an LCD screen and one without. </t>  <t> They demonstrated how to navigate through the menus and presented the voice recognition and energy source components and the charging stand. </t>  <t> They discussed their modular design. </t>  <t> They discussed the parental control module and the titanium casing. </t>  <t> The production costs were below budget for the basic models. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert presented three important user requirements, and also the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion. </t>  <t> He then led an evaluation of the prototypes according to these requirements. </t>  <t> The group did not feel that the remotes sufficiently met the criteria. </t>  <t> They decided to continue working on the design and to take out the LCD screen and voice recognition. </t>  <t> They discussed the modular design and its advantages in attracting customers. </t>  <t> The group discussed how to incorporate the fashion trends; it was suggested that one shape was used, which could be customized with skins. </t>  <t> The Project Manager led an evaluation of the group's experience on the project. </t>  <t> The group was pleased with the teamwork and leadership, but one participant complained that not enough information was given about each meeting's agenda. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will look into options for spongy skin materials. </t>  <t> The remote will feature rechargeable double-A batteries and a charging stand. </t>  <t> The remote can be customized for adults, children, or the elderly. </t>  <t> The remote has a misplacement reminder that sends a message to the television screen to remind users to put the remote back in the charger when not in use. </t>  <t> The remote features a modular design that allows users to add as many or as few components as they wish to the basic model. </t>  <t> The group was unsatisfied with the design and decided to continue working on it, focusing on a fancier design. </t>  <t> The remote will not feature an LCD screen or voice recognition. </t>  <t> The group decided that the teamwork and leadership of the project were good, but that not enough information was given about each meeting's agenda. </t>  <t> The group had difficulty deciding what would be displayed on the LCD screen. </t>  <t> The group felt that too much focus was placed on the functionality of the remote such that they could not achieve a fancy look. </t>  <t> The group did not feel that the prototype met the user requirements presented by the Marketing Expert. </t>  <t> The group could not decide how to incorporate the fashion trends into the design. </t>  <t> Not enough information was given about the agenda of each meeting. </t> 
<t> The project manager acquainted the team with the tools and equipment around them and then had the team members introduce themselves by name and what role they had in the project. </t>  <t> The project manager then introduced the upcoming project along with more tools and equipment to the team members. </t>  <t> The team members then participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals. </t>  <t> After the drawing exercise, the project manager talked about the project finances and production costs. </t>  <t> The team then discussed their experiences with remotes and various features to consider when producing a remote. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will look at user requirement specifications. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will look at the working design. </t>  <t> The user interface designer will look at the technical functions design </t>  <t> The production cost will be 12.50 Euro maximum. </t>  <t> Creating a remote with a minimal number of buttons yet having lots of functions available on the remote. </t>  <t> How to accommodate different television models with one remote. </t>

<t> The project manager opened the meeting. </t>  <t> The industrial designer reported on working design, explaining how a remote control works and describing its main components. </t>  <t> The user interface designer talked about what functions should be included. </t>  <t> He suggested they should focus on either expert or novice users. </t>  <t> The basic functions should include an on/off switch, buttons for channels one to nine, volume, mute and buttons for next and previous channel. </t>  <t> He suggested that a trendy design should not have many buttons. </t>  <t> The marketing expert reported on user requirements, including how users rated the importance of different features. </t>  <t> He stressed that a trendy design is important, that users zap a lot, and that remotes often get lost. </t>  <t> The project manager informed the group of new requirements. </t>  <t> The remote is only for TV, should not include a teletext feature, and should feature the company colour and slogan. </t>  <t> The group discussed what functions and features the remote should have, and whether to include DVD/VCR controls, a teletext button, stop button, changeable covers, and a base/recharger with locator function. </t>  <t> The group also discussed making the remote a rounded, ergonomic shape, and using flashing lights to help locate it when lost. </t>  <t> The project manager will write up the minutes, and put the minutes from both this meeting and the previous one in the project folder. </t>  <t> The marketing expert, industrial designer and user interface designer will have thirty minutes after lunch to work on their individual presentations. </t>  <t> The remote will have a simple, trendy design, with some kind of special feature that makes it stand out. </t>  <t> If the budget allows it the remote will include a base unit with a locator function, which will also act as a recharger. </t>  <t> Even though the new project requirements stated that teletext was outdated, the group felt they should still include one teletext button. </t>  <t> The group were still unsure whether to include some DVD/VCR functions on the remote. </t>  <t> The group had difficulty deciding what special feature they should include to make their product stand out. </t>  <t> The group were not sure whether to include a base/recharger for the remote. </t>  <t> They were not sure how much a recharger would cost to make. </t> 
<t> The industrial designer talked about the options available for materials and components. </t>  <t> He suggested that the case should be double-curved, and be made from plastic and rubber rather than wood or titanium. </t>  <t> He also recommended using basic batteries rather than solar or kinetic power. </t>  <t> He also mentioned the possibility of using an LCD screen to add something special. </t>  <t> The user interface designer went over the functions to be included in the remote. </t>  <t> The group discussed using large buttons for the most frequently used functions. </t>  <t> The marketing expert gave a presentation on trend watching. </t>  <t> A fancy look and feel is most important to users, followed by technological innovation and ease of use. </t>  <t> The younger market also likes the theme of fruit and vegetables and spongy material, which could be implemented through fruity colours and using a spongy material for the base. </t>  <t> The group discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, as well as the company colours and logo. </t>  <t> The group discussed whether to include an LCD screen, and eventually decided against it. </t>  <t> The project manager closed the meeting and told the group they would receive emails about their tasks for the next meeting. </t>  <t> The project manager will write up the minutes and put them in the shared folder, using a keyboard instead of the digital pen. </t>  <t> The rest of the group will receive instructions via email. </t>  <t> The remote will not feature an LCD screen. </t>  <t> The remote will be available in different colour schemes, but not with changeable fronts. </t>  <t> The case will be made of plastic and rubber. </t>  <t> The remote will feature power, skip, volume, mute, teletext and menu buttons. </t>  <t> The project manager had problems using the digital pen to write the minutes. </t>  <t> The group were not sure to what extent the remote should incorporate the fruit and vegetable theme. </t>  <t> The industrial designer was keen to incorporate an LCD screen, but the others were not so sure. </t>  <t> The group were not sure whether to use plastic and rubber or titanium for the case. </t>  <t> They were not sure how to use fruity colours without being too flashy. </t> 
<t> The project manager opened the meeting. </t>  <t> The user interface designer and industrial designer presented the prototype design. </t>  <t> The remote has buttons for power, mute, teletext, volume and channel up/down, and nine numbered channel buttons. </t>  <t> The group discussed what buttons would be needed to enter channels 10 and above. </t>  <t> They discussed adapting the docking station so it could be used with other products but did not make a decision. </t>  <t> The remote is plastic with different coloured rubber strips on the sides and rubber buttons. </t>  <t> The marketing expert led the product evaluation. </t>  <t> The group were generally satisfied with the design but did not think the remote was technologically innovative. </t>  <t> The overall score was 2.6. </t>  <t> The group worked out the manufacturing costs. </t>  <t> The group had problems figuring out the cost of the docking station and buttons, and did not know which kind of chip to use. </t>  <t> They discussed using kinetic energy to make the remote more technologically innovative but decided against it. </t>  <t> They eventually decided that they could not afford a docking station. </t>  <t> They did not have time to evaluate the project process before the end of the meeting. </t>  <t> The group will fill out a final questionnaire. </t>  <t> The remote will use a simple chip. </t>  <t> The remote will use a standard battery and not kinetic energy. </t>  <t> The remote will not come with a docking station. </t>  <t> The group could not agree what buttons would be needed to enter channels 10 and above. </t>  <t> The could not decide whether the docking station should be adapted for use with other products. </t>  <t> The group did not know how much the docking station would cost. </t>  <t> They were not sure what kind of chip they would need or where to find this information. </t>  <t> They were not sure how much the buttons would cost because they seemed too expensive. </t>  <t> They were not sure whether they could afford the docking station. </t>  <t> The project manager wanted to use kinetic energy but the others were not convinced. </t>  <t> The group were dissatisfied with the final product. </t>  <t> They did not have enough time to evaluate the project process. </t> 
<t> After introducing the remote control objective, the project manager demonstrated the SmartBoard technology they would be using. </t>  <t> They tested it by drawing animals. </t>  <t> The project manager informed the group of the budget, before beginning the discussion of current remotes and initial ideas. </t>  <t> They considered taking the best of their competitors designs and making a multifunction remote. </t>  <t> It needs to be useable internationally, with few buttons. </t>  <t> The considered options for the shape of the remote control, imagining how it would fit in the hand. </t>  <t> The group ended the discussion by touching very briefly on some materials issues, and discussed remote covers. </t>  <t> Individual must come up with their ideas for the next meeting. </t>  <t> The interface specialist will look at button and over all look. </t>  <t> Specific ideas as to components and materials are to be left to the next meeting. </t>  <t> They will look further at the idea of covers in the mext meeting too. </t>  <t> *NA* </t> 
<t> There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. </t>  <t> The target group will be people below 30. </t>  <t> It transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes, especially if they include LCD screens and speech recognition. </t>  <t> Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose. </t>  <t> The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. </t>  <t> The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons. </t>  <t> They plan to include an LCD screen to display relevant information. </t>  <t> Other functions are served by push buttons: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down with the last three types being prominent on the device. </t>  <t> The exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting. </t>  <t> Each member of the team will come for the next meeting with their views on function and design issues that they had not time to consolidate during this meeting. </t>  <t> The solution to complaints about remote controls being difficult to learn is to focus on an intuitive design instead of a thorough manual. </t>  <t> The idea of interchangeable fronts was mentioned again; if it were adopted, the company should be recognisable in all the available fronts as well as the remote itself. </t>  <t> The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons. </t>  <t> An LCD screen is going to be used to display information, but would not be interactive. </t>  <t> The buttons are going to include: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down. </t>  <t> There is no need for a special button to recognise two-digit numbers. </t>  <t> The power button will be placed at the top separately. </t>  <t> The less frequently used buttons will not be hidden under a flip, as it had been previously suggested, as there are not that many of them; they will just be clearly separated from the more important ones. </t>  <t> A discussion on ergonomic solutions like placing the main buttons (power, channel selection, volume) where they can be easily reached with the thumb (as many users complain of RSI), did not reach a conclusion as to whether this would actually cause more repetitive movements. </t>  <t> Some advanced features, like LCD screen with program information or speech recognition, would be very important in order to attract their target group, but there are costing issues that have not been clarified yet. </t>  <t> There was some disagreement as to whether the LCD screen should be placed at the top or the bottom of the remote. </t>  <t> No consensus was reached regarding the positioning of the main buttons (zapping, volume, power) either: should they be placed close together or more scattered (to avoid RSI complaints)? </t>  <t> A special AV button for direct access to the video channel, although its necessity was disputed, because there are alternative solutions that make it obsolete. </t> 
<t> For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use. </t>  <t> The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote. </t>  <t> Materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front. </t>  <t> The industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons (and no scroll wheel), simple battery (instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo), and advanced chip. </t>  <t> Speech recognition can be implemented, but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions. </t>  <t> He also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours, soft textures and curved shapes. </t>  <t> The team drew a provisional prototype. </t>  <t> They placed the LCD below the buttons. </t>  <t> If it is implemented, a recording button, microphone and speaker need to be included in the design. </t>  <t> Finally, they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved. </t>  <t> Packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched. </t>  <t> The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype, where they will also sort out the details about the buttons. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will carry out an evaluation of the product. </t>  <t> The push buttons are going to be made of rubber. </t>  <t> The chip needs to be an advanced one to be compatible with the LCD screen that is going to be incorporated in the design. </t>  <t> Making changeable fascias can allow for the integration of this or future fashion trends in the device. </t>  <t> The team agreed to place the LCD at the bottom of the device, below the buttons. </t>  <t> TV settings will be included in menus there instead of having separate buttons for them. </t>  <t> They will implement speech recognition as well, because their target group like such gimmicks. </t>  <t> The case will be titanium with a plastic front with rounded buttons. </t>  <t> Parts of the front (like the bottom where the LCD is and the top corner where the logo is) will also be titanium. </t>  <t> The chip is going to be a standard one. </t>  <t> They will launch the product with various fronts to choose from including a couple of basic colours or fruit and vegetable themes to go with the current fashion. </t>  <t> The logo will be both at the front and the back of the remote; the company slogan will be engraved at the back. </t>  <t> The team found a possible conflict between the need for strong materials and the customers' preference for soft textures. </t>  <t> Plastic may be strong, but it does not necessarily look it. </t>  <t> The version of speech recognition discussed does not link voice commands to actual device actions. </t>  <t> Changing the front colours may make the front clash with the titanium, but it was also thought neutral enough for it not to matter. </t>  <t> They wondered whether to use both the logo and the slogan on the device and where it would be best for them to be placed. </t> 
<t> The ID and UI presented the drawing of a prototype. </t>  <t> It is rounded, with the front made of hard plastic in different colours. </t>  <t> The back, as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium. </t>  <t> The back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle. </t>  <t> The buttons include oval digit buttons, arrow-shaped channel and volume controls in the middle; below those, is the menu (for the LCD) and the video button. </t>  <t> The LCD can be found at the lower section of the device. </t>  <t> After the presentation, the product was evaluated. </t>  <t> This was done on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) on fancifulness, ease of use, finding the device when it is lost, hi-tech features, incorporation of fashion trends, and ergonomic design. </t>  <t> Because it was over budget, titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded. </t>  <t> They thought it would have been more sensible to have the component costs before the prototype design. </t>  <t> Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (generally satisfied), leadership (the process was democratic, not happy with management), teamwork (happy with it), and means (SMARTboard was 'a disaster' and the digital pens only good for drawings). </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> Despite disagreement regarding the position of the LCD (top or bottom), the screen was left at the bottom as it was in the prototype. </t>  <t> The sample speaker was taken out to bring the cost of the prototype down to the original budget of 12.50 euros. </t>  <t> They also decided to replace titanium with similar-looking plastic for the same reason. </t>  <t> There was criticism for the shape of the remote (thicker at the ends, thinner at the middle). </t>  <t> The project manager still disagreed on the position of the LCD: he would prefer it to be at the top. </t>  <t> The total cost of the prototype was 18.6 euros. </t>  <t> The team had to discuss which features should be discarded. </t>  <t> The only way was to go to a regular chip, but that would mean losing the LCD screen, which was integral to the design. </t>  <t> Replacing the titanium with plastic would have a detrimental effect on the looks of the remote. </t>  <t> The team discussed the possibility to leave the remaining cost at 14.10. </t>  <t> The SMARTboard was considered a disaster as they could not draw, and the digital pens can only be useful for drawings. </t>  <t> Some people thought that there was no advantage to using the SMARTboard instead of a normal blackboard and chalk, although you can save and reuse things with the former. </t> 
<t> For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. </t>  <t> The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. </t>  <t> They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. </t>  <t> They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. </t>  <t> They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries. </t>  <t> *NA*. </t>  <t> *NA*. </t>  <t> *NA* </t> 
<t> The project manager opened the meeting by explaining how to locate his minutes from the previous meeting. </t>  <t> The Industrial Designer briefly explained the internal workings of the remote,  and mentioned his preferences for power source and case material. </t>  <t> He also suggested mobile phone-like changeable covers, and the group discussed the profit in this. </t>  <t> The User Interface Designer very briefly mentioned some features a remote should have and suggested it should be multifunctional. </t>  <t> The Marketing Expert present the findings of the usability study. </t>  <t> The group then discussed their target group ,and what features they might include to attract them. </t>  <t> The manager introduced new requirements to the project, insisting they were to be followed. </t>  <t> The group then discussed what buttons they might need, which included menu, numbers, channel and volume changing arrows and mute. </t>  <t> The design of the remote control is to be carried out at the next meeting. </t>  <t> Individual actions for the next meeeting can be found in emails to be sent. </t>  <t> The buttons will consist of number, a menu button, arrows for changing channel and volume, but also navigating the menu, and a mute button. </t>  <t> *NA* </t> 
<t> The industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept, discussing which buttons will be needed and then looking at some examples of existing remote controls. </t>  <t> He suggested using a yellow case with rounded edges and the logo at the bottom, and large, clearly marked buttons. </t>  <t> The interface expert informed the group that young people like curved shapes, soft materials and primary colours, and suggested making a hand-shaped remote in plastic and rubber. </t>  <t> He talked about the possibility of using a scroll button, and the different chips which could be used. </t>  <t> The group discussed using an LCD screen, but did not have enough information about costs to make a decision. </t>  <t> The marketing expert talked about new trends, including the trends for spongy materials and fruit and vegetable themed products. </t>  <t> The group had a discussion and decided to create two designs, one with an LCD screen and one without, and the interface designer drew them on the board. </t>  <t> They put off making a final decision about using an LCD screen, scroll buttons and a menu button until they could find out about costs. </t>  <t> The interface designer will find out how much an LCD screen will cost. </t>  <t> The industrial designer and user interface designer will stay in the room to design the prototypes. </t>  <t> The remote will use a normal battery. </t>  <t> The case will be made of hard plastic and rubber. </t>  <t> Whether to use an LCD screen or not. </t>  <t> There was a lack of information about the cost of an LCD screen. </t>  <t> If they can use a menu on the TV screen if the remote does not have an LCD. </t>  <t> Whether to have a trigger-shaped power button. </t>  <t> Whether to use a joystick rather than a scroll button to navigate the menu. </t> 
<t> The industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design, made of yellow rubber and hard plastic, with large, mostly blue buttons, a joystick and LCD screen. </t>  <t> Led by the marketing expert, the group evaluated the prototype on a scale of one to seven, based on a set of evaluation criteria. </t>  <t> The overall rating was two. </t>  <t> The project manager calculated the production costs, which were too high at fifteen Euros. </t>  <t> The group discussed how to make the design cheaper, and decided to keep the LCD screen, but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons. </t>  <t> Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting. </t>  <t> Overall, the group were satisfied with the creativity, teamwork and available equipment, although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> The remote will have an LCD screen. </t>  <t> The remote will have regular push-buttons instead of a joystick. </t>  <t> The remote will be a normal colour rather than a special colour. </t>  <t> There was some confusion about the agenda. </t>  <t> The production costs of the initial design came to fifteen Euros, so the design had to be changed. </t>  <t> Which features should be removed or changed. </t>  <t> Which chip would be needed for the revised design. </t> 
<t> The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project, describing what the project would involve, the role of each participant and the agenda for the first meeting. </t>  <t> He the demonstrated the equipment the group would be using, and the group practiced using the SMARTboard by drawing their favourite animals. </t>  <t> The project manager then went over the project budget. </t>  <t> The industrial designer gave a brief presentation about his role and his initial ideas for the project, suggesting that the remote should be used for multiple devices and that the group should consider using bluetooth rather than infrared. </t>  <t> The project manager then asked the others about their initial ideas. </t>  <t> The user interface designer agreed that the remote should control multiple devices. </t>  <t> They also discussed having glow in the dark buttons, using bluetooth instead of infrared and using a display and/or a joystick instead of conventional buttons. </t>  <t> However, they were unsure about what the budget would allow. </t>  <t> The project manager suggested that the remote should be rechargeable or not use much power, but this might be difficult if using bluetooth. </t>  <t> The project manager closed the meeting. </t>  <t> Each member of the group will work on their individual tasks. </t>  <t> They will receive information from their personal coaches. </t>  <t> The group will design a trendy, original and user-friendly remote control. </t>  <t> The remote control will be sold for 25 euros with a profit aim of 50 million euros. </t>  <t> The remote will be sold internationally. </t>  <t> The production costs should be no more than 12.50 euros. </t>  <t> The remote will control multiple devices. </t>  <t> The remote will be sold directly to individual consumers rather than companies. </t>  <t> The group were unsure about whether they would be selling their product directly to consumers or to electronics manufacturers. </t>  <t> It was felt that the low production costs would not allow them to create a trendy high-end product. </t>  <t> Whether using glow in the dark buttons and bluetooth would mean that the remote consumes too much energy. </t> 
<t> There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. </t>  <t> The target group will be people below 40. </t>  <t> The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one. </t>  <t> The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. </t>  <t> The use of infrared, energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested. </t>  <t> The remote could light up via LED's placed inside. </t>  <t> Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose. </t>  <t> It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition. </t>  <t> The design can focus on such customer needs, like finding a mechanism to locate a lost remote. </t>  <t> The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels, volume, program selection, and speech recognition, with a focus on simplicity of design. </t>  <t> The industrial designer will look into what would be an appropriate technology to help users find their remote, when it is lost. </t>  <t> The project manager will add the minutes into the project folder. </t>  <t> The ID will present the components concept. </t>  <t> The UI will present the user interface concept. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will need to find information on current trends. </t>  <t> LED's can be used to light up the remote. </t>  <t> Using them sparsely, as in mobile phones, could bring down the cost. </t>  <t> It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it. </t>  <t> The latter would be preferable to implementing a backlight into the remote. </t>  <t> A single, large, round button can be used for both volume and channel selection by using the four separate quadrants. </t>  <t> Another button to switch between two channels could also be implemented. </t>  <t> The remote will also include volume and program selection, and speech recognition. </t>  <t> A recharging cradle can be added to compensate for the extra energy consumption. </t>  <t> LED's would signify extra energy consumption. </t>  <t> Power-saving LED's are available, but these could be more expensive. </t>  <t> It's difficult to choose a technique to find a lost remote. </t>  <t> They cannot install a special button on a TV, and using a special signal, like clapping, is tricky, because it needs to be differentiated from normal sounds. </t>  <t> Similarly, using an extra base station would probably be too costly. </t>  <t> Adding such features may complicate the design and escalate costs. </t>  <t> There was a challenge regarding the need of the digit channels, based on the fact that they are not often used, and they also look dull. </t>  <t> Despite that, customers may want them to be on a remote; furthermore, they can be designed in a more attractive way. </t>  <t> The discussion also focused on their replacement with speech recognition, as the latter helps with locating the remote as well. </t>  <t> However, this solution may prove too expensive. </t>  <t> An expanded target group may have to be taken into account in order to achieve the projected sales and profits. </t> 
<t> For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use. </t>  <t> The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote, and could also provide themes for other target groups. </t>  <t> They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device. </t>  <t> Cases can be flat, single- or double-curved. </t>  <t> They can be made of plastic, rubber, wood or titanium. </t>  <t> Hand or kinetic dynamos, batteries, and solar cells can be used as energy sources. </t>  <t> Possible interfaces are push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCDs. A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute. </t>  <t> Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote. </t>  <t> The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells. </t>  <t> The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition, in black and yellow, the company colours. </t>  <t> The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype. </t>  <t> They will think about ways to make their product different from the others in the market. </t>  <t> They will also try to find a way to promote the corporate identity in the design of the look and feel and interface. </t>  <t> The ID and UI will also have to figure out whether to use rubber just for the buttons and side finish, or for the whole front of the remote. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will carry out a product evaluation. </t>  <t> Changeable covers for the remote control can link the product to current fashion trends, but also trends followed by other age groups. </t>  <t> A scroll wheel will be included in the design. </t>  <t> A regular chip will be needed for this. </t>  <t> A single-curved rubber casing can also be used. </t>  <t> LCD is not going to be implemented. </t>  <t> The preferred energy source was a combination of batteries and solar cells. </t>  <t> It is not clear whether a kinetic dynamo can be used, because it is unlikely that a user shakes the remote enough, as one would do with similarly powered watches. </t>  <t> The use of a scroll wheel with integrated button was debated, as not everyone was convinced of its use for this project. </t>  <t> Using the speech recognition on the device may not be convenient, since the remote will have to pointing towards the TV at the same time for the infrared to work. </t>  <t> LCD screens may add an extra hi-tech touch, but given all the other features, it might be too much. </t>  <t> The company colours (grey and yellow and black) did not seem sufficiently bright and trendy to everyone. </t>  <t> Printing an image on the remote to make it more colourful is doable, but cannot be done by the manufacturing department. </t>  <t> The front could have a rubber finish, or the buttons will be made of rubber. </t>  <t> It was debated that customers may prefer a total spongy texture, not just in the buttons and the sides of the remote. </t> 
<t> The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. </t>  <t> It can be used as a normal remote, but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface. </t>  <t> The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well. </t>  <t> The rubber case is yellow with grey or black, with buttons either made of plastic or rubber. </t>  <t> An extra button could activate/deactivate the voice recognition. </t>  <t> The prototype proved extremely over budget. </t>  <t> The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition. </t>  <t> One way to compensate for the loss of features, but still attract their target group, would be to add more colour to the design. </t>  <t> After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). </t>  <t> The criteria used were fancifulness (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (2.5), whether it is easy to find (1), sponginess (1.5), number of features (1). </t>  <t> Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory, but the digital pens were alright, but not too useful). </t>  <t> The delay in providing costs of components was criticised. </t>  <t> The prototype will have to be redesigned, so that it is compatible with the budget constraints.. </t>  <t> The idea to include a solar cell as a power source had to be abandoned, due to the escalated costs. </t>  <t> The same happened with the speech recognition. </t>  <t> In order for the cost to come down to the original budget of 12.50, they also had to replace the rubber of the buttons with plastic and not use a curved design. </t>  <t> The prototype proved extremely over budget. </t>  <t> It would cost 22 euros. </t>  <t> The team thought all the changes to accommodate the budget requirements made a very dull device. </t>  <t> It was suggested that they go for a completely simple design so as to maximise the profit, although this was not what was asked in the project requirements. </t>  <t> The device cannot be a hi-tech, innovative one any more. </t> 
<t> The goal of the project is to design an original, trendy and user-friendly remote control for TV. </t>  <t> The team comprises the project manager, the marketing expert, who is looking at user needs, the user interface designer, looking at usability, and the industrial designer, working on the engineering and materials. </t>  <t> The project will be completed with three further meetings: the following meeting concerns the functional design. </t>  <t> The project manager gave a quick overview of the equipment available. </t>  <t> The remote  needs to be produced for 12.50 euros in order to be sold for double that amount. </t>  <t> The whole team tried out the SMARTboard, by drawing their favourite animals. </t>  <t> Afterwards, they discussed briefly their first ideas, including the use of light materials and usability concerns. </t>  <t> *NA* </t>  <t> The remote is just going to be for TV. </t>  <t> The design should generally be intuitive without changes that would render it an unfamiliar object to customers. </t>  <t> The team will also take into account possible usability issues concerning disabled people. </t>  <t> They also agreed to choose light materials. </t>  <t> *NA* </t> 
<t> Customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes. </t>  <t> They like innovative technology like speech recognition and LCD screens. </t>  <t> It also transpires that remotes are easy to lose. </t>  <t> Everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design, and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes. </t>  <t> The need for clarity of button functions was mentioned. </t>  <t> On the other hand, materials should be more durable. </t>  <t> The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. </t>  <t> There are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40, the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. </t>  <t> They drew some of their ideas, and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the LCD. </t>  <t> The most used buttons are going to be placed on top. </t>  <t> It might be possible to use a charger for the remote. </t>  <t> The concept of the design will be finalised in the next meeting. </t>  <t> The ID will present the components concept. </t>  <t> He will also check into the importance and possibility of using rechargeable batteries and a charger. </t>  <t> The UI will present the user interface concept. </t>  <t> He will also draw some ideas for the shape of the remote. </t>  <t> The marketing expert will need to find information on current trends and see into the financial issues concerning the integration of a charger. </t>  <t> The team will also examine whether they can use an LCD and/or speech recognition. </t>  <t> Finally, they will try to think of a name for their product. </t>  <t> The target group will be people below 40. </t>  <t> The remote will only be used for TV. </t>  <t> The company colours and slogan will have to be shown on the device. </t>  <t> Buttons should be made bigger, with clearly defined functions and of durable materials to avoid fading of the symbols. </t>  <t> It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it. </t>  <t> A button that sticks on the TV could be pressed to make the lost remote beep, and perhaps also light up. </t>  <t> The remote is going to be a universal one. </t>  <t> Because symbols may fade, the additional covers could include those. </t>  <t> The remote will need to be different from those available in the market in terms of shape and colour. </t>  <t> The important buttons will be on top. </t>  <t> Speech recognition and LCD screens could be added to the remote control, but they might be too expensive for this project. </t>  <t> The industrial designer wondered whether the remote should be universal or programmable. </t>  <t> Symbols on remotes fade with time. </t>  <t> It may not be technically possible for a universal remote control to create menus for various advanced settings on the TV itself. </t>  <t> Different TVs have different functions incorporated in their built-in menus, making it hard to know in advance which buttons you can do without on the remote. </t>  <t> It is difficult to organise or limit the number of buttons in a way that makes the remote easier to use. </t>  <t> The team also discussed extensively the positioning of various buttons. </t>  <t> Using a charger for the remote may be too expensive. </t>  <t> Consumers claim they would pay more for a remote with LCD screen, but adding the component might be too expensive. </t>  <t> In the case where it is added, the issue would be whether to place it at the top or the bottom of the remote. </t> 
<t> The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. </t>  <t> The rubber case is yellow with black buttons and dark yellow for the menus. </t>  <t> There are buttons for teletext, favourite channel, mute and OK. </t>  <t> It incorporates both LCD screen and speech recognition. </t>  <t> The prototype proved over budget (17 euros). </t>  <t> The main contributing factors were the LCD and speech recognition. </t>  <t> The latter was taken out, along with the special colour. </t>  <t> Everyone agreed that the financial information should not have been given to them at the last moment. </t>  <t> After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). </t>  <t> The criteria used were look and feel (1), whether it is easy to find (1), whether it is easy to learn (2), use of LCD (3), speech recognition (7), trendiness (2). </t>  <t> Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (satisfactory), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard could be improved in terms of response time, the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time). </t>  <t> Finally, the decided to call their design Triple-R. </t>  <t> The PM is going to finish the project report. </t>  <t> The UI and ID will send him their design to include. </t>  <t> Because the prototype was over budget, the team decided to take out the speech recognition from the design. </t>  <t> They also discarded the special colour, and decided to rely on the changeable covers for an attractive look. </t>  <t> The remote control is going to be called Triple-R. </t>  <t> The production cost was 17 euros, 4.5 more than the budget. </t>  <t> It was imperative that some of the features had to be taken out. </t>  <t> There was disagreement over whether the special colour should be scrapped and the look to rely on the separate covers. </t>  <t> Other solutions, like abandoning the curve of the casing or replace the rubber with plastic were also suggested. </t>  <t> They were also not allowed to raise the budget limit. </t>  <t> The precise use of the LCD was not defined: it could be used for TV configuration, or, if possible, for displaying the TV programme and previews. </t>  <t> Although the SMARTboard was useful to draw ideas quickly , it could be improved in terms of response time. </t>  <t> Similarly, the digital pens did not allow the user to work on more than one page at a time. </t>  <t> The team were unable to communicate amongst themselves in between meetings, which hindered the flow of information. </t>
