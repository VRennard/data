are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that bit better ? am supposed to be standing up there ? so we've got both of these clipped on ? she gonna answer me or not ? i've got yes . both of them , . jesus , it's gonna fall off . tu tu tu tu hi , good morning . i'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . this is our agenda , we will do some , get to know each other bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as understand . now , we're developing remote control which you probably already know . we want it to be original , something that's people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , , trendy , appealing to wide market , but , not hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , even pooches should be able to use it . , first is the functional design , this is where we all go off and do our individual work , what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . conceptual design , what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . we're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , i'll go first , and sum up the characteristics of that animal . so , i'll leave space for everyone else . we're running out of blue . i'm not gonna ask you to , i'm going to tell you that's supposed to be tiger . and see them as majestic , and independent , and proud . now , who would like to go next ? where did this come from ? is that your lapel then ? there you go . you can what i'm trying to make ? it's actually sitting , so it's sitting , it's not standing . it's sitting down . see it as one thing it's very supportive . it's your best friend and your you can talk to dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . dogs can som sometimes can make out between thief and person so these are the three unique features belong to dog . i'll have go . leave me space at the bottom , i'm little , you can get to the top , with standing on chair . since you have chosen the ones wanted to do , i'll have to have to go bit random . does it look like dog actually ? and also , my drawing skill isn't that so , . as you can see , the quality of the work today is gonna be bird . it's outstandingly good . now i'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like beak now , so . it can be crocodile , it can be crocodile . is it gonna be it's gonna be bird . was it was an at first firstly it was an attempt at t_ rex and then it changed into pelican but it can be crocodile now actually . and i'll have to think on the spot of things that it is . scary , strong , that's about it . i'm very impressed with your artistic skills , mine's are dreadful . this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in . hope that clicks in , i'll just i'll hold it on , . dear , what happened there ? hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . again this is off the top of my head , was gonna do big cat too , . dear , it doesn't look what like what want it to be . it's not vampire bat honestly . and somewhere there's body behind . that's my dreadful that's the worst yet , that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's flying animal could have been seagull , never thought of seagull . seagu , not seagull . an eagle , again i'm thinking on my feet goodness . suppose they're all so independent , i'd put that one down again . they're good at golf . indepen independent , , did you say they're good at golf ? no , an eagle . , i'm not good at golf . i'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing . and , birds of prey aren't they , dear , intrepid . i'll put that , intrepid . there we go , hope that pen's gonna be . that was fun , . finance-wise , we've got selling price at twenty five euros , which don't actually that is in pounds , . it's about , . one point four like that . one point four euro would make pound like that . , something like that , so that about seventeen , seventeen pounds , something like that . should we be making notes of this ? we can just refer to this later can't we ? but havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're they're about twenty pounds anyway . so , so , i'll be able to pull it up , or could put it in the shared folder . so , it'd still be , we had to buy one . so so suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we or or is it going to make our product look cheapie-cheapie option ? production cost's at twelve fifty , so half of the selling price is taken up by building it . pretty huge margin . and profit aim is fifty million euros , which is yi yes , , presume so . in our first year ? you've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by all age groups just we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone user-friendly to everyone . big target group . so yes , yes , don't think we have to don't t's case of worrying about different languages and things like that , making that key point , just that it's going to be in the international market like australia , america , things like that . what are your experiences with remote controls ? i've got we got we had three videos , t_v_ and amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls , that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now . that , you wanna integrate everything into one like . it was quite cheapie as , so that might have had something to do with it , but that was quite good , the fact that you could you didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . use all the ones at the same time . my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme t_v_ and videos and things . but on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , that basic functions , don't could go any further with it than that , so , suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as . the main that's the main anyway , and you don't want to hate hate looking at control and seeing million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button like that . and symbols that you don't necessarily understand , symbols you're meant to understand that you don't . so simplification of symbols you could think of . when they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and section opens up to the other functions where you can do sound or options recording , things like that inside it . 'cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , it's obvious what you're doing , . actually that just raises point , wonder what our design people think , but on mobile phone , you can press key and it gives you menu , it's got menu display , wonder if incorporating that into the design of remote control might be useful , so you've got little display . menu , alright . was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user , may have an di display like that , like mobile , and with menus . with menus , , . and if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also . what about the older generation ? what about granny and grandads ? my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting like that . you mean to save it lesser number . can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ? don't think they tape things , don't think they use , , the age gap . my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so . so that's problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , that's gonna be problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , and that's another issue how we tackle that . what it just needs to be as long as it's self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause , menus on new phones now they've got all these pictures and which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do . don't like the , the new phones that have got windows-based running system . find it really confusing , kept getting lost in the phone , di i've not got new one but my friend got new one and was trying to do things with it and kept getting lost , but that's just me . don't how for twenty fi , or twelve euros fifty how much of excellent screen you could get , you'd you'd have to keep it down to black and white thing anyway , i'd assume . is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing . teletext has got that option as . or what about dual function ? in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . the other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone design features again , it could have flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have bigger screen in the the flip over . that's cost thing , don't how much we're gonna know about yes , no that's important . it might it might save bit of space , it's instead of looking bulky , it might look small . but it might have its cost implications . and there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , ? something that's easily moulded and produced . i'm treading on your territory . , we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation . just just quick thing about the about what you're saying about the does does it need to be fashionable ? the had quick look at the company website and it's like the the we put the fashion into electronics , so think the whole design thing might be qui you don't you you can still have plastic and it'd look quite good but . but , it doesn't have to be that , that was my main point , we don't have to use metal , if using plastic does make it cheaper , presume it would . would it would probably . there's sky remote controls and everything . they're moulded and look bit different , and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks bit smarter , so that's we can think about . so let's break it up there . so , see you in half an hour . do we go back to our room ?
it's up there ? that screen's black . are we done ? , this is our second meeting and might be bit all over the place . our agenda for today , do you want us to give you second ? no that's , . i'll go over what we decided last meeting , , we decided upon universal control , one handset for all , t_v_ , video equipment . that it was important that the product was accessible to wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , that thing . our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have bit of you can see it , . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . we discussed flip-open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . three presentations , i've got written here so shall we hear from marketing first ? is it if postpone that til later , want to get access to little bit more information , is that ? no that's fine , that's fine . i'll go first . can grab the . what do have to press ? f_n_ function eight . there we go . this is the working design , presented by me , the industrial designer extraordinaire . this is where went bit mad with powerpoint so . what the first thing question asked was what are we trying to design ? device which just sends the signal to the t_v_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some signal to change the state of the t_v_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . so decided i'd have look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . but although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make that our design stands out and that was something that wasn't really my area because i'm dealing with the inside really . so , ran out of time so couldn't do this one as fun as the last one . and found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v_ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . most of them are powered by some form of battery . now our one , i'm i'm not whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple batteries but those can be quite bulky so didn't you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control . could interject to ask question there , is that appropriate ? you're saying the triple batteries are small or the surrounding it ? no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , they have to be this certain size to fit those batteries in . the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , ? the the you can you can get the circular round ones but i'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across . and which leads onto the next point about being small and easy to carry round . now the ones at the moment are small but was just wondering if we could look at something bit smaller . now the main components came up with were the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , as said about the which batteries we were gonna choose , we can discuss that later and then you need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller and to turn it into an infrared signal which we're going to use to send the information . now these have wireless range of up to about five metres which is suitable for anyone who's watching the t_v_ unless they're in cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . and then was just had quick look at the external design but left that mostly to the interface designer . and so this is what had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . it's not proper circuit , i'm not if it'd work or not , i'm not even confident that those are the real the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the u_i_ interface which would , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r_ data which could be decoded by the t_v_ receiver , which means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever whatever form of communication that the t_v_s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's wh t_v_s use at the moment . and then finally , we want the it to be available to wide audience at low cost so all the components that i've put forward are low in cost so that that should be good . it should should be different enough from the alternative products to get good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that was thinking about , because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , that was just general point there . that's very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so refer to that , whenever you like me to present . al , and , that's that's what came up with there , so if you wanna . would you like to continue on from that ? or , move the laptop over . it can be , that's with me . why's it not working ? why's it in the ? the plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? no , no it's just . actually some of my points might overlap with what william's just mention , but my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which we'll take feedback from the marketing because , haven't had some marketing data and every product is marketable . so purpose , as william already said , would put it to simplify the interaction with t_v_ to make make it as simple as possible . and to summarise would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having lot of complex button because you can have an engineering having hundred buttons and having remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . so what the concept is to have flip-top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the flip-top . so it's like it could be accessed by wide ra range of audience and we can punch in new features such as added features such as shock proof body and design to appeal to lot of people . findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used remote control for say year and they they are not used thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . as we saw we we have to make profit also so we we can go for an economies of higher production by fifty million we said ? with that we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . that's so this is if you ask me personally , would make flip-top with trendy design and we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be bit hard after continuous use usage and all that . so in overall simple and user-friendly design . any comments like , if you want ? we'll chat about it at the end , so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , , it's vibrating , that's strange . have got to keep this here ? you'll have to you can't it'll have to this can't be pulled . does it matter ? i'll have i'll have to move it won't ? we just do the best we can . you'll have to push it bit more . will it manage ? bit more , dear . this is more than enough . there we go , i've got bit more of the cable . there we go . you can pull it out now . just pull it closer little bit . you should be able to and , there you go . get it over , , . look at that . , i'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and our starting point with marketing is always market research . so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had hundred subjects there . our findings , lots of findings , i've just summarised some of them here . the overall thing which i've i've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent would spend more money when remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but that's quite high proportion of our our , , international target group are prepared to spend more money that's bit nicer looking . current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user overall . you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap lot , so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . so again there's power implications there . fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again big design issue there . and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , it's slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and that ties in with the the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . slightly more than quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . those small movements of the remote control can lead to shoulder and elbow problems . the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid in when they've lost the actual remote control , some speech recognition . something we didn't put to them , but which i'm thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off bleep every now til you find it or flashing light , possibly . that trend reverses in the older age groups . so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it reverses , they're not so bothered with this . had marvellous tables and things that could show you , but i'll just keep it simple , if there's any more information email you extra details , is that ? we have new project requirements , we're not going to be using teletext , the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . our control is only going to be for t_v_ , it's not going to be combined control , which limits all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . so can we not programme video with this remote control ? it says for t_v_ only , so looks like it's just , sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but , what do you think ? it just said , for t_v_ only . would that imply video use ? but , general t_v_ controls do do video as . dunno 'cause the if you've . you bu som you get com you get combined t_v_ and videos don't you ? if and if you got if you got sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the t_v_ anyway so on to on to like the t_v_ hard drive or so . we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming . anything about that on the market research like regarding whether people want combined something like that ? we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons , those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on and it's general knowledge that people do find programming their videos nightmare . so if that's something we need to look at . ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that anyway . i've just called up that table there , we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . would you prefer an screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in remote control ? so you can see how the the yes no varies across the age group there , and substantial number of in the older age group , that's just general fear of new technology . bu we do have budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so when we can take cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing because it is something it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , on the t_v_ you could put like pack on the t_v_ so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the t_v_ and it beeps and you're like it's over there , something like that , but that's that sounds lot cheaper to me . but on on that again thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off loud noise to let where it is so that could be quite . that's super idea . the third thing was that we have to make the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . so we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy , what you were talking about with the marketing . people paying more for it to look good . we need to focus on that as . yes , further market research will be needed to focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for fifteen year old for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . what is attractive to trendy new yorker and what is attractive to retired south african , , you get the idea . it's it's gonna vary around the world . at the end of the day , the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may and the fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . so are we talking of single model or five , six designs ? you could you could have number of different designs inside they'd be essentially exactly the same . the features could be same and the body could look slightly different . what about you were talking about the buttons , the controls that are coming out now have big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , , 'cause we got to make it original , what about with the touch screen computers ? that's what was just . so you it's like little panel that you touch rather than button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not about the you don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . no , no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just . think that might appeal i'm thinking japan , i'm thinking young , office people , trendy thing . yes it will appeal to sections of the market def . but quite , , easily labelled so that anyone can that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to the older generations , were too big . but also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics there's physically different things 'cause if you've ever seen the x_ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big because they're just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which is so if you what 'cause you you can have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others . to as it it was indicated that risk of repeated use , the injuries , touch screen could be better option for that . so , bigger so you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market . for u_s_ and all you can have slightly bigger remote control and in japan and all you need to have small , . we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , . the internal engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , . it's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , . i'm concerned , when you read the the r_s_i_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , don't think just moving your finger around on small screen is going to deal with that enough , that is still question mark issue how we deal with that . r_s_i_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . i'm really can't get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to future meeting but it's something we should think about . was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes . know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes know . or speech recognition , which is extremely expensive , that's the only way that you avoid that issue . speech recognition , but . do we have to initially , looking at the findings here , focus on younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . do we really have to go for everyone away ? we could focus on the biggest market . if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? and when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people . we are we're talking about the type of company that we're working for as . that they want it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations . now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have greater population than us young people , but don't think we're focusing on that , we are focusing on mid-range , business class type people . i'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the broad scale marketing stage , we want to , , not waste money , not be profligate and focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for product like this . so the remote control functions . we've got the t_v_ , we've got the video , now there's 't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , yes . we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that always found that really easy when discovered it , because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not if you're going to , you put the number in and it's just number , it's not date , it's not time , it's not channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that , it's just number . just whack in the number . and you wouldn't you wouldn't need whole host of extra buttons for that , you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway , . you've already got the numbers for typing in anyway . i've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful . it is after if you look in the newspaper , t_v_ guide or any t_v_ guide there's five , six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times , and it has been around for quite long time . it's been been around for long time it's just it's not very advertised as to how to use it and things . no it's not but if awareness was brought to the forefront about that . though if if you've got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series . but just to have that function would be would be really good . can run this past you while it occurs to me , don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that's what led us on to comparing t_v_ remote controls with with their design features , , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with phone that you bought for them if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones . is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having similar service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , , which button is it press for this ? as free as free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? but the only problem is that with mobile phone you signed for contract so they the companies who who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out and also it's it's fair enough to have some help service but i'm not how much the cost would be of having , instru instruction books feel reckon can cover that . the functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your t_v_'s not doing it . taking your t_v_ and your control and saying look this is what i'm doing , it's not working , what should do ? yes if it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel , but for if there were any more or are we definite it's only gonna be for t_v_ and video , we're not gonna put any , just thought . but they're there's customer service , there will be customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , the person has to walk to shop on the high street , . it will be too much of an effort for person to for phone he might walk down the street , but for remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that , yes . and they're , they should be . but we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages . puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes . it does , you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . what other functions ? we need i'm not if we need design decision now , but we should think about 'cause you've got the dilemma between batteries , that's what was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with charger , you could you could bundle charger in with it but . they la they they last quite long time , and if you had when you the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or at night , but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts long time once it is charged . something like that should reduce the size of it . and if if you if you had if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could on that as so . it could be on that , . so are we talking of concept of rechargeable something on the remote ? some docking station or . rechargeable with docking station . so the rechargeable which would be your field . that that'd be fine , and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time . yes , which it is cheaper in the long run as . the shape you got trendy . don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want tiny little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple , they do . and we don't so many remote controls look identical , these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the the surface . we definitely an ob an obvious thing , very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that . so we've got flip-screen . what was thinking of design which nokia came up with almost six or seven years back . we have flat one it it looks like box , like chocolate . that's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like you can say banana shape thing , curled up like boat . slightly curved , curved . so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . so it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't so we can have like moulded according to your the way you hold of it's semi-circular in the bottom , something like that . 'cause it's moulded to your hand anyway . wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but smooth . can you look into the company logo ? things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . if it was c_ like that , you could have it in vague c_ shape that opens up like shell , , something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that's there . we could look in at that but . look at the mobile . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells , logo could become as you could put logo in the corner of the model , rather than , trying to make it like sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . need to think about how it's gonna look different . that's that sounds really attractive idea , i've not come across anything like that before , if it and that opens out into your flip-top . then it's to you can make it lightweight plastic , to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying prevent lot of that would think . it's really idea and plus you can get even though we're using plastic , you can still think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do conch shell or scallop shell exterior . we could look in at that . or you could do different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . you could have different casings . so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and . less chance of it being lost too , it's not like chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as ki if it looks attractive enough as ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either . it's easier to bit to handle . we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . but we can like think of five , six designs . we have to round it up , . can quickly go over the new project requirements so that haven't missed anything . so it's no teletext , it's only for t_v_ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , something about videoplus . that was in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date it's kinda takes the place of having button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . so when they press for programming you it comes up on the , reminder about using videoplus ? so that they have look at the guide and or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add-on feature ? so it's doing away with the programming feature ? it could be it it yes , it could be adv advertisement feature , rather than design feature , , drawing attention to that . and it also paid lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful . and the rechargeable batteries . was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements ? we've got the buttons but we'll work through that with the design of it , . that's not at the moment requirement , it's something we're looking at , what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . and we've talked about there being an alarm , beeping for being lost , . for detection , . learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . but there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the the instruction manual , if we deal with that , . and different from what's out there . what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? or shall generally look the issues involved ? you might get guidance , but instruction manuals , 'cause there tends to be demonised thing , , they're everyone's got like big pile of them , but no one really uses them . whoops , questionnaire four . 'cause we're at lunchtime now . you can email me , if there's any more questions . and i'll be able to not answer them .
i'll until you're all hooked up . put it on in that way . welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . this is our conceptual design meeting , we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , . was getting that impression as . this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . so we've touched on few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . the minutes from the last time . we had couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . we have decided on leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being flip design and different shape from what's normal . we were thinking shell , but something along those lines , just different shape from what's normal , . you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , and our market was going to be young , business , range . so shall we start with the first presentation ? yes if you feel it's . we just connect up . there we go . so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im i'm i'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , project manager . we decided on the most important aspect required in remote control device and we'll come to that later . so that was one of the first things we did . also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . so the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . they also also want remote control to be technologically innovative , and , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . now should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? there also seems to be trend towards spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year . so lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan . be interesting to see what our design people make of that . let's start from the inside and work our way out . it's with me . unless anyone has any questions about that ? don't , not yet . that screwed in ? hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them . this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . first the into the method . the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t_v_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . also in this study i've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available . findings , i've got my little picture there . this is the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five which is what's used in every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it's used for all all t_v_ remotes at the moment . and then we we're loo looking into battery options . there's actually no rechargeable option available , so we saw the the standard double and triple which we thought were bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , that that might be bit silly to be to be honest , people won't it's it's like wind-up radio . wa can you explain that ? so you wind up your remote control before you use it . how what how long can you get out of that , can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? it might you , , presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but don't don't t's really necessary when you you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got t_v_ . or that doesn't count though does it ? does does light charge as as sunlight does ? it was u_v_ like any , any i'm pretty that solar is from the sun . alright it would the the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need physical handle to wind up . has to be solar . regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so standard triple might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space . don't counts electric lights no , but not many you don't want to limit your market . artificial light , no . that's going to know , different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally . people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people . but and most people most people also watch t_v_ in the in the night anyway . but then it would be charging through the day , the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening . but the the next one's the best anyway . the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in you get it in wrist watches and you you don't even notice it . i've seen but then if you think about watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving lot of the time . the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . and are these like what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ? it's it charges into some form of it's smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size watch watch battery , 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches . and that'll that would would last for do i'm not entirely how long it would last but i've never seen one run out . we solar would be slightly expensives . and but then again it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only tiny amount it's it's it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side . if you'd you switch the t_v_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . is it really gonna be enough ? and for the same the same reason , you're only using it for incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it and you put it no no do don't think the the draw on it would be . so it's not the draw on it isn't . could ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ? could people put standard batteries in but with they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible ? ye you could have dual power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look identical . so that affects the exterior design . they're they're expensive , they don't the normal batteries would be the cheapest i'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , but the it's they're not very resistant to dropping , 'cause if you drop if you if you have the size you'd need to charge remote wouldn't be that big but if remotes always get thrown around and , so . what price are we looking at for presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? it's twelve point another question is like . they're not designed practical-wise . calculators you don't really throw around lot whereas remotes you do , they can they do , they they've got dual things , but they're the batteries are smaller . you do get bit of wear but don't calculators have battery in them as ? again it de . which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like charging like mobile phone every day . remote control , like , so we have to look at the life also . so the the the if you if you had something du using the standard batteries and the solar charging , , don't think you'd the it would how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last . it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , it's not gonna add anything , . it would , . can we add in an attachment to closing feature ? can we think about that ? 'cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's add it in to think about because , where am ? shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because personally , . if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do we're doing something original and different but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much . but then that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls . it's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research , it's not thing that people are looking for when we threw it open to the field . but it's something to put on the side to think about . 'll move on . my second part of my findings the mo most current remotes use this silicone p_c_b_ board which pr printed circuit board , which has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends different message and that then gets translated by the chip into code and then it's fired out of this l_e_d_ in the sequence of on and off bursts . what things do we have to consider there ? can we what size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of . ll this the thi the thing about is they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the the size of the nine buttons in . if you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could you could put them virtually next to each other and have much smaller switch on each one , if you if you wanted to but the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some array of switches which i'll speak about in the next bit so that and then to , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in standby mode no while not being used . now what was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see wh the buttons are , like on mobile phone , they do it more often than on than on t_v_ remote , but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . the case material , i've been sent what the factory can actually give us , the there's the plastic which we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing and the the main problems with the you could go for wood but it would be bit impractical . titanium very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , you're saying that people like this spongy feel this year , so perhaps some something made of rubber , but was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti r_s_i_ . i'm no i'm not how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . the problem with the casing is that there's quite there's quite few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . if you go for titanium they can only do standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be little more they can they can do curved shapes . but whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units for the flip phone . second thing is and second question is like , mobile you can change the cover , you call it skin or whatever . so in this case if you're looking at like customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red like that . so is that feature available in like titanium , or it's like only specific to plastic or . in in titanium don't don't would be available really , the ju just it you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is it's light and strong but it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for remote . it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . i've got mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like rubber cover that goes over , that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to have different fasciae for the phone . and you can peel them off . so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off . like rubber sleeve almost , . something like alright . that could be good idea . it could it would be comfortable to hold on also . very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy new one if they want to . that's been really popular with mobile phones so don't see why not . also the just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the kno we were planning to do some touch screen . now what was saying before about instead of having you could have just bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i'm you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . the second option they offer rubber buttons , but that an type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin and don't take up much space , two they you can have them in array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in set thing and you could have them like touch display . didn't get the last part , you're talking of just what you said didn't get the meaning of it completely , you're saying like . what what on the on the screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it , but you can you wouldn't have with the you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board . with also with the . don't to interrupt , don't see why the curved thing is problem , if we had shell , once we open that , so it'd be , . it would be flat inside . you could have flat screen inside , , but i'm just wondering whether we want an screen inside . have misunderstood you ? it wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there'd be touch touch buttons , so you wouldn't be pressing down on , or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-r_s_i_ . it would be good to have contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , like one of the palm pop thing . hadn't hadn't really thought of that to be honest . had another idea , if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i_ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like small pointer thing when people want to . you could , you could have some stylus that you could pull out but they could get bit easily lost , 'cause had . for somebody who very often , if he would person who switches channels very often or does use particular function very often will find it very irritating to use and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . they're easy to replace as , cheap . it would have to be attached . just thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? pencil or pen , so they wouldn't really need . we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that . that's that that's the end of my . that's you , . and just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like . that that would be fairly simple , you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking . i'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it applies to both our designers here , so i'm not how it would fit in . if we flip open , now how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? and they respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's little compact mirror and when you press button it then goes onto the phone display the remote control display thing . we're marketing to as much as we are to women . they don't look at themselves ? t's remote control , you were sitting watching t_v_ are you gonna want to open it and say shit should go and have shower and do my hair before put the t_ , no , no . you mean , it's with us using the ideas for mobile ph it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones kinda got sidetracked onto that , . trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but we'll leave that one on the side . you can you could do it , you could have 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an display it'll completely blank it out , but if you could get any mirror effect on it , i'm not about . forget about the mirror that was just very quick passing thought . would like to share something which did here . first thing is on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . so you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous designs here . and second thing is there's too much of confusion here . no particular remote is standard . like , some some people have here you see this ? this is on found that only common feature is the ch channel control and volume control , rest other buttons , they are in very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models and all . and second as already discussed with william , we are going to have g_u_i_ interface in the in the middle of the flip-top and graphic user interface which is what we do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is like you have on icons you have is good example of g_u_i_ graphic user interface . what does that stand for ? if you if if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this screen . so not point or click press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . and on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . so he need not use pointer to keep changing the channel if person is frequent surfer . so we are having combination of boards , so on the simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . can we swap that round so that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? 'cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like mobile phone . no you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be wouldn't you ? isn't that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , . but you can do it with your thumb li . that's what was just saying , and then have the and then have the at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls , so have the the volume and the programme , things like that , on the lower side . and you mean to the and the lower distance . so the findings are too many cluttered buttons . repetition of certain but buttons which already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . all are confusing and in inconsistent . we had latest finding of voice recognition , there was mail which mentions that our division has developed new speech recognition feature . we have to check into the for financial feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at low cost , but for like we had response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers am here . some thing or it gives bleep sound or some sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . so we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . my personal preferences would be like , as already marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so wouldn't say the design should be like fruit , but we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , red chilli tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like , if you see the previous slide most of the users would now be acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . 't see that , is that play and stop and things ? this is central one , the one you volume and channel . or is that volume and channel ? so keep that that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look the models , it's here . this and voice recognition . i'm not how long we've got left , but we need to make decision about the things we've discussed . so , we agree on do we agree on the battery ? that means that there's no function for li the port , that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . if it is it is qui it's quite feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them , or it will be cheap to re-manufacture them . it's bi it's like it's gadget , it's selling point . so do you reckon that's good idea that , where's the remote , i'm here thing ? that would be quite fun . the only the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , but we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things . to t's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got black and white one , they use them in calculators so . the l_c_d_'s not cheap . we could start with the black and white . that that way we could upgrade later . and you could . we talked about kinetic charging , we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double or triple batteries ? do you want like back-up ? no , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double or triple batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ? no the kinetic ones come come with watch battery that goes in watch . , got you . so it's lot smaller , so it would . got you on that , didn't realise . so we've got battery . the inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ? so there's not really decision to be made there , . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare-board or on the top one you've got the touch and then , . the were we're going for the on that one , on the buttons , on the on the on on the top one we're gonna . on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-r_s_i_ ones . could you repeat that last part ? on we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . and for the . no , it's fine . for the body design plastic , we could use the body , for the inside and rubber as padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . for the inside . so we decided on rubber casing for the plastic shell , variety of designs , . so , so . and it is just although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like shell that we discussed , just go for the colours . no we don't wanna be tacky if we've got different shape anyway the fact the the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the yes . it's it's different . so we could just pick anything . is that going to be this image i've got in my head of something shaped like that , about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , is that fancy ? it's just different it's just different from everything else and , i'm trying to imagine clean looking houses , beige and black so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway , or you want something that contrasts as like you get clocks now that are more of talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and . i'm just pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but agree . we looked at those remotes , they are anonymous , very similar looking things . this would definitely be different enough , wondered if anybody could come up with something even more the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be relatively cheap to produce , that if in year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , which is another beauty of it . and you would just have an across the you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little . and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes , you could just go so far with it , like puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so that's quite flexible thing . you can you can just . acupressure , you could talk of acupressures . and finally the body should be retouchable , may ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , it should be moulded it with the design in such way you can change it every time . with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside . we've got five minutes , , or that might've been up for while . so can recap sarah , for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , display on the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . that's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ? fine , we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it remote control if it's lost . so , are we looking at voice ? yes , it was just , there was just cost issue with that , but it's good idea we just need to check on the cost , is that ? or like william was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains . for , the whistle . the whistle ones , . so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for whistle . and incorporating the company logo ? didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design . 'cause took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from from your report , it's not just case of having little r_r_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product don't they ? they do , but we can you could is , it is , you just address that with advertising . since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's gonna be ours . you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . it'll have logo on it just like everything , but everything else has logo on it . the point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but it does , without that so i'm not worried about that . did we know at the last meeting we spoke about beeper , that was you talked about beeper for location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? depending on how we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . depending on the expense of it . and they've got in stock , so . but we'll find out more about cost afterwards . i'm going to wrap it up there . got end meeting now message on my mo so . so we've probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes so think we've probably got about that time before we come back . you got to go through . it's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and how long that took . we are pretty going in clear direction now . is everyone happy ?
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like noodle the whole time . is that someone's ? you all switched on . presume we're good to go . minutes we decided to use kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't gonna be problem factor . we wanted stand-by function . the case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . buttons with combination of and rubber according to the design . bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip feel . and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ . is that for us ? that would be you . me and william worked on prototype , and william is going to make presentation on that . though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and i'll i'll show you the presentation . make the camera's yes , yes you can . hold it like , so it looks crazy . can nick your whoa . second , i'll get it out . going bit crazy over here . you should have one of those things and you can just take it off . where are the hinges ? so this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation . and we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there . it's gonna have plastic body with standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like white or light blue . you able to look ? this is underneath the rubberised the rubberised outer casing which there'd be wide choice they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . the wide choice of colours and patterns , so you've got you've got lot of customisation with it . it's an clam-shell design and the the top screen that you can see that would would be how do you say , it's , it would be inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would so so it'll fully close flat . the black and white touch screen wherein people can . so it's flush . and working on the inside we've already said decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as , so that you could probably get bit of . so put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 'cause it's the top part that's . we decided that the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . so you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , i'm here , . it it won't shout out i'm here . it'll just shout out i'm here , to similar effect . i'm under the sofa . oka infrared could be here also . or , that would be too complicated . if it was going like tha that could be something for next time , . you can have remote that tells you exactly where it is . the standard , there's be standard transmission with the t_v_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . it would it would have 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate p_c_b_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some cabling . and because , , all t_v_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . and the infrared sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we haven't don't think we actually put it on . , something like that . actually , no , it would be it would have to be on the on the front . on the front on the front side of that , . , , , i've got you . so when it's even if it's open here , the signals would go . it's still pointing , yes . so when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the t_v_ . that would make sense . and then finally on to the interface . the top screen , as we said , is would be an inset black and white touch screen which would have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and things to that effect . this one here . and now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have some some bezzled logo on it , inset , or an engraving of the logo on the top . which is no . but not interfering with the outside look of the product once it's . no not not actually . no , not interfering with the whole look of the the product when it's on the thing . look up to it . and finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is that's the company logo . wrapping it all up , . i've now got evaluation criteria . so this is the one . it's to be presented . there you go . this is chip . it's quite similar to what it was before , though . this stage of the evaluation is really for us as team to evaluate if we have now got product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . so this is the first stage of the evaluation . now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . so it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? now the findings that we came up with , just recap , are here . the criteria that we want in this remote control are fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . the design should minimise r_s_i_ and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of having beeper function . so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have note of those . i'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . we're going to use seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . we look at each of those criteria that i've just mentioned , i'll call that slide back up , and will just do preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . does that seem clear ? any questions there ? so we're going to look at these crite yes , we're going to come to we'll discuss each one and we'll come to consensus rating between one and seven . is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the market . one is true , seven is false . so won't write all of that out again . it will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or , , c_ , d_ , , to confuse it with the number rating . c_ , d_ , , . this is where realise how tiny actually am . just write small . criteria and rating . actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . how about that ? so you can . so i'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . criteria , the fancy look and feel . how do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is fancy look and feel . one is true , seven is false . my own rating for that would be two . one is true and seven is false . i'd i'd probably put it two , two or three . i'll just go this way . no , three . would say two . would say four . adding those up , we've got six and five , eleven divided by four is what ? two and three quarters , it that . two and three quarters ? two point seven five , there we go . criteria , criterion , technologically innovative . would give that three . i'd give it one . not that you're biased in that it the designer . no , no , not . got it wrong . the first one rating , i'm . can you just make it two ? the average , for you ? it the other way . you want your rating to be two ? in , got two point one is , seven is false , . is that what you're saying ? so , i'll work out the average for that again at the end . it's very slightly altered , and we're just waiting for your rating two point five , . it's just two point five for that one . losing one decimal place , that's . so what are you rating for this one , paw ? so that is eight . that brings it down to two , and simple , . ease of use . easy to use ? based on what you've said there , would say one , true . would say two . would say two . should've said two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't ? we'll just put almost two , because i'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . one point seven five . or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . so i'm just thinking , before give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . that's no , no , the the base colour was white or or like or light blue , but the changeable fa faces would allow you to get any any one of number of colours that it's full customised . is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? with for the plastic ? so we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . , and no , no , 'cause that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that otherwise it's just hard plastic . and the spongy feel is no problem with that . because you'll be having because of the rubber case . in that case it's got to be one for me . i'll give it one as . that part was and easy . moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . don't think we've really touched on that lot . we've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . we've talked about pointers , but the very use of remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such small device ? the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises r_s_i_ it's meant to . it's meant to be . because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small , but with the amount of we're putting on it isn't that much . so because there's more space , it's not moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . it's quite obvious just big buttons . i'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it four . i'd i'd i'd go for five , actually , 'cause . four and four . twenty one is that twenty one ? so that's four point two five . and finally , last but not least , easy to locate . now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about beeper , have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? it was it was voice voice recognition , . it was the i'm here thing , . and are we happy with the costs on that ? that is going to be feasible , cost-wise . , that , that's feasible . that sounds good then . i'd go for ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on t_v_ . it would it would probably be stand it would be stand it would be quite loud . so if sombody's in the other room or if t_v_s in different rooms , or . it would be . so it would be . you built into the feature . and if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . that's one for me . one and one , good . do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , but thin , . so , how do we feel about this ? we've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there . that is for incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . the lowest rating we've got , which is really it's not terribly low , it's close around neutral is for the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? we happy to go ahead ? for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . do much apart from having huge big don't . hope that's clear to the team . is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before sum up ? i'll just leave it there . i've got finance here now . i'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it , if that's . you want me to unplug that ? now presume that the screen will go blank , that . we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . so are we still on for kinetic ? see , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . it might have influenced our choice . what's happening with the electronics ? it was regular chip on print and , no , no , no , the , it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . chip on print . in the top , it's the number of . and , just no , one reg , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . so , would there be two ? and they're double curved . two , 'cause it's two . one double curve . two curves , . but it has slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . so it can rest . so what's single curve then ? i'd say i'd say it was , it's one double-curved . it would just be flat bottom with one curve . like domed thing . so just one double . and one no , 'cause one , one's double-curved , and then the other one's plastic . plastic and rubber . the other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over . we've got plastic and rubber , haven't we ? plastic one and rubber point five . and special colour . no rubber , since it's being used just as casing , we can put point five . do you think ? because there are it allows the point five , . we can use that . what does it mean if you put point five for that ? it means we are not using lot of rubber actually . we're using just very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic . it would be like saying we're using see , it says case material . so we're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ? no , no , that's it's as an extra . it's including , it's including . so that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get . but it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ? there's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . so do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . no , we don't step on anyone's toes . special colour , do we need that ? might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . the push-button's one and l_c_ display one . and buttons yes . buttons has that not gone up ? has that not made any if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ? we could change the battery also . instead of going for kinetic how about going for standard battery . is it , it's brought it slightly down . no , it was seven five it's changed not lot . so is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make difference ? uncurved , flat . it's not made any difference , has it? . no , we'll have no , no , you've got to click off to calculate it again . it's gone up again . no , it just surprises one . it's not calculated it . there we go . it's brought it down slightly . it might you might you might be assuming that that is in euros . it's not lot though . it could be in dollars . and then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve . is there anything on the menu no . we haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though , , so the highest we've got is the electronics here . ri it's in euro . and the interface . if we tr . if we moved away from our much loved idea of kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make huge difference ? and going to regular bat . the standard , it it would make one difference . the biggest one would be taking away if you took away if you to . what feel is , customers never said anything about the battery . it's internal , nobody looks into the battery . but shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi where's that special form ? and people are used to buying batteries , they're not gonna say i'm not getting this , 'cause i've got to buy battery for remote control . if if you take away the voice , do don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . should we see what difference it makes ? where's the where's the voice recognition ? no 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker . if you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . the kinetic is three . if we change it to the battery it's that's minus three . they , but you minus three plus two . keep seeing zero . we can do it some other way , we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition . we could do the voice recognition for , , business class , , like an upgraded version . you could choose to have that or not . but they but in don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now , because they they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . but we're still working to head we can put in our recommendations . so should we just change the design specification then ? make it costly . if we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as result of the meetings . we we could , we could say , and then say we recommend . but we need to work to that specification to start with . and the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as in first instance . as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so . we can make the price fit , and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , because it also sets it apart from the crowd . 'cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it . they like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different . it's something completely different associated with your company . , so it's two point five . so if we take voice recognition out we are . that'll do it . twelve point three five . we are close to the budget . is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? no , it's twelve point two five . not meaning to doubt your words there . two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five , isn't it ? are they really going to quibble about ten p_ ? it's twelve point five , then . or point zero one of euro ? which is less than ten p_ . what it said fifty percent of the cost . so half of the price would be it is the first one . the agenda one was where the price was , wasn't it ? that's today's kick off meeting , . twelve point five . so we are under the budget . that's what it was . done , people . so is that got us covered for the electronics then ? we don't need something else to take that place ? 'cause that that was just bought-on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , . except voice recognition , everything is . so we've done that . we've done room for creativity , haven't we ? because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make . presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . in the sense that did you feel like team ? or did you feel like autonomy ? i'd say , as team . although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to bounce off each other . we had time . find out from each other , . and i've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . there was very constructive feedback by everybody . it's not like people trying to cut each other . there is more of true cohesive teamwork . we came to very predic creative design , . and sarah , you coordinated the work very . how did you find it ? no , it it went really and , feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good . it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , it would've come out little different , but . liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , , it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field . you two created that wonderful specimen of play-doh model . that was the best part of the . i'm still not caught up . but that's nothing to do with the teamwork . we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as side line . and fake r_c_s . no , that was quite fun . means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? how do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? discuss which ones . could it've been better , was it adequate ? we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more . had time to , 'cause we could just say , what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , . but it was having it there . like the whole picture of the thing . moving around the room . but it's good , like we spent times individually . never thought of remote control with flip top . it's new ideas in general , rather than . it's really borrowing from other areas , it's , , bringing things from other areas in , it so it's nothing is new , but it's applying it to in different area . it's the thing is , , go on sarah . they have to come from somewhere , don't they ? and as sh as , you go . as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly . they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's something we should think about , but no one's put any deal of thought into it . do don't think the the companies are really concerned . they're just like we've got d_v_d_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? just jazz it up bit . they don't really think about it , because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . they're trying to ship the d_v_d_ player , the video player , the t_v_ . the focus isn't on to that , . but then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , if you could have something that's proper funky thing , funky item that's individual , individual to you , they could even go into you go in with an idea and they design it on photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray you would pay lot extra , because it's individually being plastic was being made for you . but people could have anything that they wanted . surprising to me is like people give lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like real want to see new launch like that . because of the produ . and new television products coming up , but nobody giving much idea to this . it's really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , this is the first change in remote control devices that really , , say is is obvious and visible . like sarah was telling , everything's . we see it in mobile phones lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed lot of our ide our ideas from . there are innovations in that that people don't really want . see people wanting model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and it's wonderful our company's so and d_ based . it's innovation for money's sake . the the people have to keep buying . but forcing it onto people , . it's things that , , they might want to buy the thing they really want . and you can't get you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , because the phones have moved on , things like that . or there isn't cover to fit it or whatever , . in closing there we go . see it was just the produc just the production cost of the phone . our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but , what do you think ? do you think that's takes into account overheads like us being paid thing ? and the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? that was just the the physical . so it looks looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . so increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . fifty percent more . don't from the market research . but but you were saying that that's quite . but in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . we've done what we were required to do , and there'll have to be another project team or new project for us to look at at those things . don't think that's something we have to look at and find way of raising the cash for . it was it's top secret . we've done very to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that people are really gonna want . it's shame it won't ever get made . they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it . someone'll run down and patent it . it's it is it's conspiracy going on here . the project has been evaluated and truly . that's what it is . and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . there's final questionnaire . so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that fell behind with , so i'll be delegating in my role as project supervisor , so good luck . celebration , you didn't talk about that . the celebration is the twenty five pounds . either that or we'll be dancing on the desks . is that it then ? just the last , . i've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy . didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time . was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your thing ? but do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ? questionnaire seven was the one did just before the meeting .
so start of the first meeting . so agenda of the first meeting . where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . we are to get acquainted . so does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ? i'm the marketing manager . i'm the user interface designer . am the industrial designer . and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader . al , so tool training . so does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? i'm not exactly what you mean by tool training . see , so we shouldn't really be , so . so we have the project team , which is to to come up with new remote control device . we have the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for period of time . and our idea is to to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to to get bigger market share and bigger audience . so method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . so in each of these phases we'll be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this this device . and having meetings so that we can during the course of the day come up with better better inst implement than we had before . and therefore have successful conclusion to the day . and you'll be doing various designs throughout the day to meet this end . so we've got tool training . try out whiteboard . so we will . so everyone's to supposedly draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . this is make the whiteboard works . so who wishes to go first . do you wish to go have first bash at whatever . good job got pockets today . your microphone's just . but now you you you'll move out from the microphone and the camera . take it that would would so . are we supposed to do this now , do you think , or ? or technical problems . you've lost your microphone there . here we go . you designers are meant to come up with these things . that would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat . little smiley cat there . and this would be because they're very independent , they're very intelligent , compared to dogs . and they can be very very affectionate . some people don't but know very affectionate cats . and they can look after themselves . i'll i'll shall see if get across without just tangling everything . shall rub that out , actually ? don't see as there's any need to . there's plenty of space . we can have have whole menagerie . we've had more time to prepare over this side , so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets . didn't think of that . pens are over here . the three pens are underneath . i'll try the red pen . i'm gonna go for the bear which i'm be able to draw very , but i'll have bash at it . you get marks for artistic impression . lost it there . i've just knocked the microphone . so you're just doing the face . we'll then we'll go for small small bear . and like my animal that looks nothing like bear because because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and like that . i'm gonna go for the dog , and i'm gonna draw one badly as . looks like it's going to be dachshund . that's quite good . there's my dog . like dogs because they're very loyal . and they're always happy , so whenever whenever you're feeling bit bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always quite excited . so you can always have lot of fun with dog . and they're also good for exercise as . you can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . and and when they're tired they're quite cute as , so . that's why like dogs . 've not actually had too many pets over my time 'cause to be honest with you i'm not too keen on them anyway . not to worry . so what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got few fish and so hopefully won't prove too difficult to draw . as you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as . and one of the best things about fish is that they don't really take too much looking after because with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get friend or whatever to look after them for you . whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in dripper feed which feeds them over the couple of weeks that you're away and change the water every couple of months , and buy in few plants , so . other than the fact that they keep dying , fish are are not are are are reasonable pets in that they're low maintenance . if we're still all with us . work has been done on this project where by twenty five euros is the expected selling price . that information has come from our marketing manager here . so we're looking to sell internationally , not just in europe . we're looking at having our production costs limited to twelve and an half euro per unit . and therefore making profit margin of not actually profit margin it's because you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to take from from that to give you your profit margin per unit . and so depending what the the overhead costs are will determine how many units we're looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time . so experience with remote control , first ideas . so we're looking at having discussion at this point in time to help you folks design our our new model as it were . so any any thoughts ? with some remote controls the buttons were little small so they're quite hard to press so we make something with easy to press buttons . as that is the main function . so so we're looking for some we're looking for device that is robust and and therefore won't get damaged too easily . we're looking for device that is what was the other things you said there ? easy to use so the buttons are accessible . easy to use . is easy to use and see . is this just television remote ? because lot of systems are t_v_ video combined now , or t_v_ d_v_d_ combined . and one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . so if you've got combined system , it could be combined remote . or is it just television that we're supposed to be doing ? i'll get back to you on that . but it seems to me sensible , 'cause as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the about the room . and so device for for all remotes . one of the things we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as . 'cause there's quite often lots and lots . and sometimes they remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . so whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to pick up the remote . so so don't we need to think about how we could develop remote control which moves around the room . comes to your whistle . that's that's something for the future when you can talk to your television , but . but is it in sense it's mutually exclusive . you can't have both the the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as , you want any idiot to be able to use it . whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all . and so these are probably mutually exclusive options that you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more with handling them , therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on . we could have better instructions with the remote . or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or the instructions that would come with it ? we've done some research about what the cutting edge hand held devices are , and lot of them use they're like they're like mini laptops . so it's possible that we could devise system where where you're you're holding miniature computer which is controlling all your your your television , your stereo , and where if you buy new thing then it you can link it to that as , . 've got five minutes before the end of the meeting . so we have to start winding up . is there next meeting in thirty minutes . so , so we've got i_d_ the come on , where's my there we go . if you just click return it should be . it'll get rid of the message . if you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message . that's what was looking for . so we've got function what happened to the . that might be back to the start . if you grab the slide to the left and pull it down ? so we've got the working design for i_d_ . for u_i_d_ the technical functions design . marketing , the user requirement specification . specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach . are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ? and i'll try and write up some minutes of this meeting to to give it to you for the next meeting . i'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for . is this mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ? you just said at the start it was television remote control , so we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise . television remote control . that's true , 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going . but at this point in time you're that shall we make it just t_v_ . so we will depart . we will stay here and and break off . and i'll do minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour .
so where's the powerpoint presentation ? microsoft powerpoint , . so we've got so we've got new project requirements . so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options . we have we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one . i've got one too . that's to know , one from each of you . new project requirements . so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to got or or three things , relating to the remote being only for t_v_ . we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty what we came up with anyway . so it actually we won't be forestalled in sense . we've got teletext outdated . did you get any information on that ? we didn't , no . and the corporate image was the final thing . so got that in email form . so if we go ahead with the with the three presentations . so we'll start with yourself on the basis that , . i'll just i'll grab the wire out the back of this one . what is it ? i'm not quite how it control doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . you've got to do control eight . alt function eight . again not doing anything . there's usually little thing in the top for the hang on , it's just coming on . there , it's doing something . pressed about five times now . have to go again . hopefully that should be it this time . i'm gonna be looking at the working design . of the of the remote control . i've just got three sections , first is the research made on the on the remote control itself . and then that involves the components required in it and the systems design of the actual the actual remote . so having researched the existing models within the market , found my research off the internet . i've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . and then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . the basic components are an energy source which in most existing models would be battery supply . whether that'll be two batteries , four batteries , it may vary . we then have the user interface , which is the like the the buttons on the actual remote . the various functions used for changing channel , channel up and down , volume , things like that . there's also chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . and then the sender , which is usually , i've found , an infra-red device which sends signal to the actual television . and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that's found in the television . i'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because it was little tricky on powerpoint to get this working , so . i'll just go through there . do we have cloth to wipe this down with , or ? it's that little . there's the rubber on the , . i'll get rid of the bear that's . so we start off with battery suppl no , power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery . we then have particular button , which may be that's there's lots and lots of different buttons . but this is how the basic system works . that sends after you press that that sends the message to the chip , which then sends it interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . that's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together . so this is the user interface . this is the chip itself , which then , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . and then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have receiver . and the sender sends message to the receiver . so the the top bit's the power source , yes ? yes , that's the power source . going on to personal preferences , i've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . you don't want cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really remote . and then the sender , and infra-red has been used quite successfully . if the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly . you don't have to be point directly at the television itself . so the battery is the in the sender . and that's it for the moment . so , now more design . mine's not quite as complicated as all that . that's what we like to hear . did press function ? is it control function ei , there you go . so i'm gonna talk bit about the technical functions design . i'm louisa , the user interface designer , as . so the basic method of this is to send signal from the remote to the television set , so that desired function is performed . an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , so you need two different buttons for that . to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . to switch the television on or off , standby button . here are two example remotes . by the look of it they both have play and fast forward , rewind functions , so they incorporate video function which we won't have to worry about . but as you can see , the left remote is quite quite busy looking , quite complicated . whereas the remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . so my personal preference would be the remote . so , it's got big buttons , it's got very limited number of buttons . they're , kinda clearly labelled . like the use of the symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as as the words on the play functions and all that . so it's very very user friendly , and it's got little splash of colour . could do with some more colour . there's couple of things there . we have to remember that we have our own logo and colour scheme . so we'd have to we'd have to be putting that on the the product . do we get to see that ? will you be presenting that in bit ? haven't as yet , no . but got got an email that said to make that whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan . so i'm guessing that notice on the bottom there it's got what's that ? a_p_o_g_e_e_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour see in that is the red . would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the circular section , because that seems to be for video as . so we could dispense with that little bit as and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . what do you mean by the circular section ? like all of that bottom bit ? just this little bit is that that's still video remote part , so we could get rid of that as . and don't really think that you need nine numbers . the on the for for general television purposes you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we'd have to have some room for future such channels . how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . like how often do you hit nine ? it's just people are used to seeing that , so if we didn't have them then they might t's . but but but , possibly but the the other thing is that with the current expansion of channels in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but how many channels do we have to actual television channels do we have to prepare for ? would have thought that it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the b_b_c_ have come up with further six and there's exactly how many channels there are on when you take into account sky and various other various others . so would've thought that we wouldn't , , rather , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it'll take second 'cause you have to be able to stop it . you could have fast forward on the on the channels that and then you could dispense with more otherwise . you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted . some remotes have favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , if that's favourite you just like by-pass two to five . suppose in sense you could have if you've got hundred channels then if you had an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty and then have second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time . but lot of like cable and sky and , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers . limit the number of buttons , user friendly . but suppose nine's not really excessive . suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you it's like multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . suppose it does make good pattern . so with that we'd by-pass any problems with . that's true , , you could get fifty by five and zero or whatever , that that makes sense . 'cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need . so so what was the circular thing that you were if it's just for t_v_ , which is what it is at the moment . that's just for video , so we wouldn't need any of that . so we could get it down to what ? so we get to how many buttons have we got ? we've just got ten , eleven twelve we got fourteen that we need . which isn't really too many . that'll be quite easy to make user guide for fourteen button remote . 've we've got that it's remote for t_v_ only otherwise project would become too complex with which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations . i'm did you have that information behind the marketing , or was to give you that information ? had i've had some market information , but not from the company , no . , so time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery . we've only got about another four hours left . so is everyone happy with that ? yes yes , that seems good . that's the end of my presentation . i'm gonna pull this off . if you just give it second to catch up . she said twenty seconds to what was that last wee bit there ? i'm we'll have by the end of today . i'll give it another go . there we go . we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . and first off we should state that the remote control's for controlling the t_v_ and how do people use it ? we asked them which buttons were useful for them . how how does remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control . and we did that by giving them questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that even higher proportion would spend more for fancier remote control and that of all the buttons on the remote control , the setting buttons for the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , they weren't used very often . people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . we also asked them about speech recognition for remote control . and young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got over about into thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . there's lot more there's lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as . we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . and the second second biggest frustration what that if they got new remote control , it was difficult to learn all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . so my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sleek good looking high high-tech design which looks high-tech , . and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should concentrate on the channels and power , and also volume and that thing , as as louisa said . we could come up with menu , an menu for other functions on the remote control . that's worth thinking about . and we could think about speech recognition as , because young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at high-tech design . that that might be the market that we're we're looking for . and we could think about using speech recogniti recognition as way to find the remote control if it's lost in room , rather than having it to speech recognition to change the channels . 'cause there's problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . and that's the end of the slide show . do lot of there's key rings that you whistle at or clap at , 't remember , and then they whistle back , like that . about speech recognition ? speech recognition , . but that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't . youn young people pref , they they said that they'd be interested in remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in remote control that you could talk to , so . no what it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . and possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . we can have some sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some buzzer system between the two . so you can press button which is always kept in one place and then it buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . we'd have that would mean we'd have to put two products together as , which which again would probably be bit expensive , but . that is true , yes . that'd probably be really simple , they're cheap . so it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote . so you're trying to avoid having second product 'cause you could have second product that gave you the pitch which would set the remote off to say here am thing , without sound recognition . but if you know . was gonna say sharp noise , clapping of hand or whatever . you'd want to try and av just have the one product that if . if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device . talking about vo if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it command , set command whatever that happened to be . but you've then got the point if if you're not going with voice recognition then . you could have an option to turn it off . or perhaps , . so that would solve the problems with the t_v_ speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . so any sugges , any conclusions ? would it take quite while to develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? it does then we can't . it's that simple , because we've got three primary requisites from from and email that was sent to me whereby we had the design logo was one , which we've already mentioned . we've got the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly . and the third thing was that teletext as far as the management is concerned , is becoming dated due to the popularity of the internet . so that means that so these are the three extra parameters that have been put on this project . so we're being focused effectively directly at television and it seems to me that the management is wanting us to go down narrow path and not opening out . so anything that is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical . has to be simple enough to suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . but probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras . added extras would be , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within this short time window , which effectively now is four hours . so and if and we've gotta get to the end . first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with added extras if possible . so about five minutes . so need to . so how long we have left of our time . but we have to make the decisions on the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next meeting each person that's got task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . we'll also know when the next meeting is so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task . and then we can report back at the next meeting and say yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed . does that make reasonable sense ? yes that seems . so we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing . and if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not until the next meeting . do it via the email so that rather than coming if you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate . but if you get it before the next meeting , let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting . is there would so . so do we need to decide on the functions now ? it'd be really easy and it'd be big advantage if we did have some whistle back function . and and that was that was the number one frustration that people said , so . 'cause that'll solve the frustration of losing it . don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so . don't really know about the voice recognition thing . we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , and if something comes back i'd go more , more for clap . if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short , you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as selling point for the product , something that's quick and simple . so , sounds good . and that wouldn't put off the older generation either , 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be scared of this new technology . so clap rather than whistle would be on the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , now something that doesn't like whis . no not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option , but if would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , so so clap option . no , clapping , clapping , . we've already decided that we don't need teletext button , haven't we ? is that one of the . ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying , that if if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext , so so take out teletext . taking out teletext , . did we decide on having the ten the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which enabled you to put them together . so , so zero to nine . nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you second or two to press another number , so you can press any two and it'll put them together . ten numbers and then some device to allow i'll put delay to allow multiple numbers . or multiple digits . did we decide anything about the other functions ? as in setting the audio and tuning it and like that ? you had an had an idea about the menu ? we could possibly put an l_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that . but just thinking people probably you don't have you only have to probably tune in the t_v_ once , but you have to be able to tune it that once . so and if finally the t_v_ breaks , you get new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . you can't really avoid that . except the new digital markets which do it by themselves . so that'll be in yes . but the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic and if it is at the moment , that's fine . but at the moment it's not , so it seems to me that you have to have device that caters , 'cause otherwise it would make it your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is and it's also it's the the product we've got is something that's at the would have said the lower end of the of the cost scale , so we're not really going that's terribly high-tech . suppose if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote 'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so . we're talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we need to keep the the tuning function in . so how would this menu function work ? would you have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . that would be good idea , . like the volume . 'cause you do need brightness and contrast and everything as . my dad was watching film the other week and it was too dark , so had to go through it and turn the brightness up . we're gonna have the the individual numbers and then menu function and slightly more advanced instruction booklet to come with it , to guide presu it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp just off like the menu use different buttons you have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work . i'm not whether the having people have booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . so next to each of the buttons , each of them could have number and then also function written next to it , so you're pressing . that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and which looked too busy and had too much on it , so . if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as , have you seen those remotes where the bottom bit slides down , so there's everything else revealed ? so that's very good idea . so you don't use it that much , you don't have to see it all the time . but it's all there if you need it . that is that is good idea actually . so you keep we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so i've been told . like hidden panel . if you've got the same . not quite , but . so so keep keep detailed functions hidden at the back . keep the other buttons but hide them away . and that'll be better for the older generation as 'cause , my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through menu , but he can read button if it's displayed properly . so so we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as . so we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , . data functions hidden at back . so the the detailed ones would be brightness , sorta . can bring out when needed . so we're dis so you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back . so sh should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then so on the about the number . we have to decide . so on front , numbers , volume . the volume up and down . and the volume ? shall we have mute button as ? mute button as . or but then they might not buy it if they haven't got one . and probably power one as . t's probably like not an issue to raise here , but the whole thing about not using your standby because of the like waste of electricity . have you seen the adverts ? like if you boil the kettle that's full that's waste . if you leave your telly on standby it powers blackpool for certain amount of time . like we should try to discourage people from standby . 'cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change . it's too much of big issue for here . we can send out flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by . so so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ? uh-oh danger sign . you probably should . but little bit smaller . are we gonna have the channel up and down as as the number buttons ? 'cause the market research said there is quite lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . so we'll have so we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? channel up and down . what else have we got ? what was that , sixteen ? numbers is ten , volume is twelve , si one up , one down . how many volumes ? and mute , . that's sixteen isn't it , . is there anything else ? don't , no . power button , stand-by , channel , up and down . so is that it ? that's sixteen buttons , you reckon . and then at the back ? you've got brightness and contrast . if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . so on the back it'll have brightness , contrast , anything else ? there's audio functions . you're also gonna have the channel tuner , as it were . so tuner up and down , . tuner , would that have up and down ? up tune one way , tune the possibly . they normally do . and then an enter button for , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . so you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , . and and enter button just to select . we're keeping it simple . we don't really need any other audio funct functions because it's just volume up , volume down . up volume , , would have thought so . so there's quite lot of like dolby surround studio , surround things . do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , or do you have to do it via the remote ? for the younger market . they've got their own controls in this like hidden panel . suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . no , like there's individual buttons for them , like on the t_v_ remote . but don't really they're for , i've never used them . know they're something to do with dolby . unless something comes up then we should shall we look into that and just get back together . you might get some research . so i'll do the minutes of this meeting . and we'll meet back at i'm not . forty minutes , believe is the time .
conceptual design meeting . so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we what we had . so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted , and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . so what decisions have we made ? have there been any changes ? we all have presentation again , so if we go through those and then . three presentation , . shall go first again ? so , fine . see this little more smoothly than the last one . let's get started . the for the i'll back actually . for the components design , next step is the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . then there is chip and still the sender . so yes including the power supply as . i'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , . any of you think of like the the old torches which you wind up . there's kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you you power up by waving around , it just requires small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . that's one option , but that was gonna cost little more . and then there's solar cells . as final option . for the buttons , we have an integrated push button , which is just to say all all these are supplied by real reaction . so for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , which is just the same as the standard ones . this says it's similar to the button on the mouse for normal for like like modern computer . there's scroll wheel which is the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume . you could do do that . one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . moving on to the printed that's on the next the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . what would be the cost do do we know ? which is the next section . for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual of the remote . the firm supplies simple , regular and an advanced circuit board . and there's different prices according to each . so if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had standard push button . one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . there's small unit available through the company which would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . and that would require more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . there is an extra cost in that sense . going to my personal preferences , possibly for power we could use kinetic which is the idea of the watches that you move you move the remote around to power it up . and this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . for the buttons , we'd probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . so if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , then we'd have to get more costly circuit board . and that's it . with the printed circuit boards you were going for the . it depends if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . but , so that is something i'll have to look into . but are we going . that's that's decision for all of us . so are we able to make that decision now in sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue , so would it not be best to rather than one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . the other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time . that's probably better one , to discuss it straight away . 'cause at that point then you've got the details up there , so if we wanted to know that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue . does that make sense ? have lot of the information there . it might not be very clear . unless you want to plug it back in to yours . we could do , . as say it only specified that we need more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , it didn't the voice recognition came as separate piece of information . no the scroll wheel required the regular , so the . if if you down . it's just this bit at the bottom which i've highlighted , but the scroll wheel requires mini minimally regular chip , which is in the higher price range . the scroll wheel , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , scroll wheel is bit kinda bulky ? the display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense . also the display's else which we decided against . but that bit and note that the push button just requires simple chip , so that would keep the price down . i've got pictures 've seen pictures with it sticking off the side of it , and they don't really look . so just simple push button , and that would cut costs on the did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? so we're going for . so is simple push button . so are we going for the are we going for the simple one , are we ? the it was what we said before , the idea that you record in set message , and then it picks up that message and replies to you . so it is the concept we discussed before . but then we for whether it would require more complicated circuit board . i'm guessing it would , but got like the definite information . we should go on what we're certain of rather than if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board . so if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? or are we going for the regular ? but is there any other , that's true for the for for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration . and so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , before we make decision . but but the way that interpret that it doesn't seem to send out signal to the telly , it just it's like parrot just rep reply replying to your message . suppose so , . so that would be something separate , . so don't would effect our circuit board . so we'd have simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . and don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . that makes sense . 'cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning jo . it might be useful to say like where are you remote . here am , jo . but that's as far as that one could go ? that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility . just as fun way to find it . simple circuit board . simple push button . and it says that it said the cost of that isn't too much . you were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply . so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries . and how does it get charged up ? it's it works on the basis they have some ball bearings inside . it's it's some on watches which you you you shake to power it up . somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . so you'd you'd move the remote around little bit and then that powers it up to use it . so the speech recognition was are we going for speech recognition ? 'cause that required the advanced had speech recognition requires advanced req require . it would be helpful to find it , but don't t'd , so . just just just for the call and find thing . did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected it was just no that's what that's what , but it doesn't . might have got that wrong . 'cause it's it's separate isn't it , it's not part of the . speech recognition you reckon then is simple . it's it's just an addition thing it's . and so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much . would that be , it wouldn't really cost anymore , would it ? shall pass on to you now ? i'll just just check what it said . actually don't really says anything about the cost , but it says that it's already in the coffee machines , so like it's already . assume it would cost extra , but we we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . and then have to change all change everything at the last minute . that was quick . so very brief presentation , . from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly sleek and sexy . haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , but there's some curved cases that you can see , range of sizes . all of them have lot of buttons there they seem to just have the rubber buttons . does that move it ? it just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything . i've found that try and get it back . if you click and then go onto previous slide . there wasn't much more to say about that , just rambling . some of the remotes that looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could where it was connected to the remote control functions . and it was quite swish model , where it can control four devices , t_v_ , cable , satellite , video , d_v_d_ , audio . so that's bit of competition there . so it's better not to try and compete with that thing and just to market it as completely different like different viewpoint as finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions . the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , there's examples of those , but they don't look as sleek as other models . and there's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not . on the price , . so you were saying the scroll buttons . there was specialist type of remote that we could think about , . there was children's remote , where they just had very limited range of buttons and they were bright and colourful and you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . but if that's really in our field ? but that's something that's out there . we're going for the biggest market , not , but was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ? 're to go for the international market rather than local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude the one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications . so you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in like you'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . but that's really where your field is . so the children's remote should be like next step , but for ours , we should . anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one i'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . that's something that we can be aware of . is that so so what are we deciding to do here ? because there's already very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be good idea to market it as finder function . the fi , the finder function rather than as speech function to find your remote . so you also said for going for the international market that some some older people might not like the speech recognition . different languages might not be compatible . it it would make it quite complicated , where ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the , . 'cause you program this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question . and ours is quite cheap device , so how much we'll be able to put into it . so you'd have finder feature rather than voice recognition feature . unless something else comes up . and you were talking . and you were talking about scroll buttons ? we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it . alright , so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons , was that ? and just to be aware that there are specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote . so not to be focused on . there was mention just as warning about button design . just to avoid ambiguity . so it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have v_ on for volume , let's think how they did this . good in in flip it round in ninety degree hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down . i'm just gonna check so do this . an upside-down v_ . so that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down . what did they say ? the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , somebody might look at this one and say this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see actually that can't be , can it ? no , they might see , they might see this pointing down and think that's gonna turn the volume down , whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up . so , be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them , because they might be two contradicting shapes . so we could have like . so we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves . you could have volume up and volume volume up , down and like that . and 'cause the idea was to have limited it was to have sizable amount of information on it . limited number of buttons . 'cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were . we got it down to not too many . and that's all had to say for that . so what was the decision on the design of the volume button ? are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna , we should see yours first . i've i've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . i've been looking at some trends in in fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market the the one that's the one talked about last time , that we'd asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . and we've also been looking at fa fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . so we've had people in paris and milan watching the fashion trends . so so just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . the most important thing was that the thing look and felt fancy rather than just functional . and second , there should be some technological innovation . and then third and less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as . and , the fashion trends are that people want clothes and shoes and things with fruit and vegetables theme . but the feel of the material should be spongy , which is contrary to last year , . presume it must have been not not spongy last year . so we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . and then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our find the thing with hand clap . and then we need to ma make it easy to use that's as third priority , so perhaps fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed . and then find way to incorporate these trends so that we capture people's imaginations . so we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , somehow . we could make them out of rubber rather than hard plastic . and then even wackier than that , we could have fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of banana like that . so that'll be it . banana or courgette . how how far we actually want to go along and follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or or , do they not matter that much ? if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use . you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , 'cause you're can mis-direct people . and would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera , so . just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . that could be little apple . and then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine , and it wouldn't confuse the numbers . no that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality . dunno fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are , it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends . but what are they gonna be next . what are they gonna be next year . but but but but you you can incorporate the tr if if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's was gonna say animals or elephants or whatever . but suppose as long as it's quite subtle design , even if the design changes , it seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as as buttons . that means you're constantly changing your production schedule , and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else , so that's not good idea would would suggest . i'm not i'm not what what what the timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is . to something which is more universal . we can imply fruit shape possibly . the spongy feel is something we could think about , . still with rubber design we could . was that in the fashion sense that this or was the spongy feel was that fashion ? it was , wasn't it ? and that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the sleek and sexy look . one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have rubber case . that fits , doesn't it ? no no no it's if you use the rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . that's the way round . if you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . which makes sense . rubber buttons require rubber case . and that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber . the the main problem is how how frequently do the fashions change ? 'cause in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to mint them out 'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is is last year's stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do . whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have difference from year to year , it seems to me that you could incorporate fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . you're just changing one aspect like like the standby button like that , and especially 'cause then you could make it something that , you might be limited in space , that yes . suppose we are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual would or not . you two are gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to how much pl how much how much how pliable is plasticine . we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . but whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , whether that would just increase the costs , make it more complicated . that's possibly it . so you're talking there about changing changing the casing . the the actual the the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same , but you could change the the way it looked . and then you could have but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that . you you could do colour change , so therefore you would that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in rather than all in black or , , which four do you want , as long as it's black ? but so yes that's true that might no not necessarily , because you could have your company we're we're meant to be finishing up . so it is possibility , . but we are supposed to use the company colour scheme , aren't we ? we haven't really seen that yet it might and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things . yes that is . you could have your company badge and logo . lot of computers like like on the one you've got there , it actually has stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , , whether the casing be any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that in sense , with with logo like that , because it's on white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so on would be white casing . 'cause you you're you're badging it . and lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own badge over the top . and the way they've got that there even if you had that on white , which is the predominant colour of the the windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from white casing product . and whether we'd have big enough market to have this like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider . it's for young people , like the phone generation , that thing'd probably go down , and the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ? it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing but i'm . i'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . with the mobiles , it's the , it's communication device , people see you with it all about and if it . suppose , where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time . it's in in the house , isn't it , suppose . so if we just went for one colour of rubber case did we decide on the rubber case ? so don't change case . change case colour . and we're saying no to that . the spongy feel , or did we think that that might go as trend ? it was different last year . the trend was different last year . it was not not spongy feel . but whether the trend will change . whether it's one of those things that like having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , whereas just the fact that it was rubber case is probably less less of something that you're gonna end up hating in year , . less likely to so then that would . if you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy complete new remote rather than just case . it seems to make sense that we we'd just stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as . we haven't really talked about the curvature of the case . there's flat , there's single-curved and there's double-curved . i'm not exactly what these things look like . mayb curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? but the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the plasticine . says that i'm not exactly . when you say when you say double-curved , what what exactly does that mean ? i'll show you the remotes that i've got . see how let's just get that bigger . see how the one i'm not plugged in , am ? no you're not connected to me anymore . that doesn't help . one one thing to cons one thing to consider is that in some ways you want by having fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other . shall turn it round for time ? that should come up . whereas if you do fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in ca packaging box that that does that . and the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product . so shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , if we have to , so shall we quickly we'll go for single curve , . so but no . it's not very clear up there , but you can see some of them have got bulges , like the second one and the end one where there's curve there . i'm not exactl if double curve is it comes up slightly , or ? that's what was trying to work out . but it is kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there . so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ? we're meant to be we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about minute or so . definitely single , double . shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ? curved or double curved ? so it's single curved . so did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? the one you move around ? that think that's good idea . we ca , we'll still have the are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ? and the rubber push buttons , rubber case . rubber rubber buttons and case . and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we , but possibly sticker . we can by by not having anything too complicated . and and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . without affecting the circuit board . and see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out . and then are we going for one button shaped like fruit . that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in couple of years . what shape do we want ? so we've got spongy feel buttons as , have we ? as as or or was that so it's rubber buttons , so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons . that's ru rubber buttons , . it was just . with rubber case ? so it's not too wacky . reasonably spongy , . and the standby button is gonna be different . an apple would be good recognisable shape . if you start getting into kinda aubergines and things , it gets bit weird . so what what shape are we making the standby button ? shall we vote on it ? we will go for the apples apples . anyone got any suggestions ? apple apple qu quite big one , as . could be red apple , . could be red . either , don't mind . 'cause we wanna incorporate bit of colour if we can , once we find out . and then we're gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ? just like the just working out what we're gonna do for the next time . that seems pretty straight forward . 'cause most of them will just be mainly circular or like very plain . what was that last thing again there ? just to keep the shape of the buttons simple . much option on that . you were going for single curve and alright . just the shape of the buttons . and , just keeping the the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as . fairly self explanatory . so shape of buttons simple . so that's that , . we should now go away and get these things sorted out . you two are on plasticine duty or whatever . is that the end ? looks like it .
so is why not save that . no , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . do you want to replace existing file , no . actually tried to transfer it to my documents , but spreadsheet . you have to you have to close that window . 'cause that's the save one isn't it , so and then find it . but i've ta , i'll just re-do it . that's the easiest way . 've made our prototype anyway . we can have good look at that . you pass it round to have look . no , it's slightly curved around the sides . it's almost curved like up to the main display as . and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . we also have apple slash cherry design at the top . so it is , . cherry would be alright actually . it's bit more fun , isn't it ? and it's kinda not really at you think apple , you think computers , like apple mac . , we might get for the m_ . what's this this one ? and cherries are fun , summery . what's that one there ? that's the mute . it it'd probably have to be labelled mute . but , we didn't have anything small enough to write . they're thinking for the first time , was hard to get the the actual labelling on the individual buttons . we just chose simple shapes for all them . the important ones are the volume ones . so we made them bit bigger . the mute could possibly be bit smaller . you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there , and the the channel is in blue . and we chose v_ plus and v_ minus . all these things have cost implications . and so when done my thing on cost had assumed that the only button that would be different colour would be the the red apple button . so however , i've now . but , so but there would be cost implication on that , and as suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be open to debate , suppose . i'll see if find them . sis yes , we'll have the slide-away . the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important , but we didn't have any white play-doh . so that's where the colour buttons came from . an important consideration . so and the second one underneath would be the idea for the , . so we've got detail design meeting . so so , we've got prototype presentation , which we've just done , evaluation criteria , and finance , so we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we're looking for from our previous meeting . so other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but it would . but other than that , we got the red apple . we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons , and the bit after the evaluation criteria is is the finance . yes , yes . and the and the cost implication . the only snag about this is that the cost is probably important . so , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to to manufacture . and whether it would , so as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in under twelve fifty or two and half twelve and half euros . so if you had to do presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ? this this is yes , this is our presentation of the prototype . that's the pr . so , there's no redesign . so that should , so , seems to me that the thing that have to do is is quickly find that . could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ? we should plug it in . do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one . so , sh this should be then . we could do it as we go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . so , by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we've got single curved case . we've got rubber case materials supplements . so , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and . have push button interface . the button supplements . originally , there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple . but so the so the real the real question then would come in . do you make all the buttons , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . do we'll do it on the prototype , so do two , see how much it is . everything else is gonna be standard . and then we'd have so that's nine point one there so we've got some . we've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , so , was originally , was thinking rubber wasn't special , but according to this , it is . so and the effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there . you just do one , don't you , for the it's just it's just one . is is is the answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore , what's the op the option was not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic . else thi the button supplement is just supplement for all the buttons made in different material , rather than per button . would every design change is , , , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , . we'd have one special colour and one special button form . and when plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and half . as far as know , that that took care of the of the various supplements . and if what happened ? you've just gone off the window into another one . it's on the bottom row . if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . so , but the point would be that if we if we just did special , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there . so it , is it is no , it's nine point seven i've got . just give us bit of switching around those on the electronics we got the sample sensor . so , that would that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . and there's nothing else as far as see that we we had planned to put on . at the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one . the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech so if we got rid of like the one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition without , . if we , that gives us twelve point seven but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the , see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and and go for battery instead . wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as ? possibly , , . how you turn that one to zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , so you need both of them ? we have to have it . we'd be giving up on the kinetic . we should , that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov , . that would give you one less . but you reckon that the thing is that you wanted to appeal to people and not have to replace batteries . since it's the through the whole technology type thing , , you were saying in the market research that people like interesting gadgets in them . whether they would figure the the sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be worthwhile thing to have . and then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not what ? the the problem was the battery's running out and losing the losing the remote . so you gotta decide which of those is more important to them . but which do you think or which do we the more important of the options ? the voice recognition . in sense , at the moment , we've got total which we need to reduce down by one point two . remember that was minimum requirement . the other option if we're planning on just going cheap and cheerful , would be to make it originally , we're gonna make it simple product . shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , and then make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? have little thing . so , we've all got note of it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on . do you want that back up ? had presentation to do . but do think the voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . and so the method is that the design team makes prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . and those ones are gonna be in response to market research , and also finance , . and do that on scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . so , got set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in financial one as , at the end . so , we have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . whether it's easy to use . whether it's incorporating the fashion element to attract the buyer . and whether it's recognisable real reaction product . and have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this , so i'll go over here . so the first one is , does the product look and feel fancy . so if we do one so . have single curve , which was like the feel of the product's quite good . so , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . that'd be considered fancy . i'd give it two . of but what is one false , or is one true ? one's true , and . seven's fal four is neutral , . and four is neutral . 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true . go for one . but it's pretty close . we've got almost everything we can . gonna put underneath so i've got some more space . so , false is seven , true is one , and so say about two for fancy , you think ? why not not , nearer three . you do an average at the end , . it's just that saying something remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options . this this is just this is just for like the look . does it look fancy rather than functional . so , so that so sh should we go for two on that ? suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . and , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show reasonable amount of speech recognition . so , what about the pr the prototype as it is , we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . but not the kinetic . but not the kinetic . like the power . 'cause you can't afford that we took that out too . no , we ca , we can't afford both . alright , so so it doesn't it's pretty the prototype as it is isn't fulfilling the . or , minute . no may is about neutral plus it it it's got something , but it hasn't got . in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . would give it more than four . the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . so , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . and if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that the other functions we've got in are are more at the the special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at just special colours is point two . now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker , you're then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . and and the simple way to do it would be to have battery , to have your sample sensor speaker , and then you're looking to take out point two , which would be come from the button supplements category . i'm just gonna check my email . i'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for the product . how much of difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . and then it stand the test of time better . interface type , plastic rather than rubber . that that that would make the significant difference . you could either you could have it if you have in plastic rather than rubber , then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . so you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . and that would enable you to to do it . so it says if we make slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so , . ye , , but it's rubber as it is , yes . read the email again and it says it's evaluate the design as it is , , so we need to think about finance after we've evaluated that design . whether we're doing it in the wrong order or . suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . so , does this need to go up bit , 'cause we've got both the both the the speech . we got we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and , we're going to reduce down from that . but the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too . for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and do you reckon two ? would've said about two as . two or three . i'd be happy with two . and the next one is i'll have to get it back up now . the next on , just sing about . easy to use . would've said yes . would go for one on that at this point in time . would say so as . incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . it certainly has some . it does , . it's got the cherry and the sponginess . say about three ? , it was just doing it quite . we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , and it's got fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . woulda said two would seem reasonable . the product is recognisable real reaction product ? this is this . that's bit rough at the minute . so this is about the corporate image of like new sleek technology and all that thing , as as having the logo on and all that . so is it recognisable product . does it fit in with our other other products , which are coffee makers and spacecraft . t's got the same speech feature as the coffee machine . also it's spongy rubberiness is bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . it depends which way you look at it . so we're going for two , three ? so two or three ? so it's so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has . two or three . the logo would be more recognisable on the actual thing . it's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . but , the logo would definitely be recognisable . and it does have attributes that other products do . go for it . two or three . that's that decided . so so we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then about two . what does what do all them numbers mean then ? do we add them up and rate or anything ? we , we add them up so at an average is gonna be i'm just gonna do this in my head . one point eight isn't it . so , pretty close to two . so so it's it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . but we've gotta try and make it doesn't get too bad . two two two , . so we need to so this is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ? you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements . do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances i'm not . put it back on . we'll probably have to re-rate it . yes , would've thought so . we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going . so what was it , control eight , wasn't it ? it's come on already . so , you can see there that the if you want to keep kinetic , , you've got choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . you've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item . actually we just have plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us in within the budget range . which gets you yes . that'd be fine . because that was just trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway . so that's eleven point seven , and then we could make we definitely had all the button supplements . different different colours , . was was thinking that because the rubber case is bit less in the corporate identity than the sleeker plastic case . and that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . so so we're going for plastic , yes ? so we'd lose little bit on the , and that would now be , that's that's within the budget . lose little bit on the fashion , , but and then . do we actually have do we just have one special special forms down here ? there was debate as to how you would count them . and we we've we've got we've got enough for another we've got nought point eight left , so we've got enough for another , but the but but but the the special colour , we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different , we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . you got special colour . originally was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour . we should just imagine white buttons . we've got special form . now that would be one button , and the question was was buttons or is that just one button . 'cause our plan really was to have one button only with special so so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same . the other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium . so , special colour , you want three in there . which we should , they'll still be fine for the for the price . thin you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , . one original colour and then two supplements , . that makes sense . that's probably it . so we only ne we only need two for that . 'cause these these are moulded . the one colour's gonna be moulded out of piece of plas of rubber , isn't it . would agree with that , . so special colours , two . and we've got special form is the one apple . the rest are all standard , although you could argue that should be you were making these buttons down the bottom , was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? ne that'll be second supplement . was that the idea ? the volume ones should stand out bit . then there's spe second special form . would have thought that's probably about . you got you got twelve . so tha so shall we do , . so that should still be . that's twelve point three , so we're still within budget on that . that makes sense . so decide we've lost little bit on the fashion and lost bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the that's without . woulda said so . so you'd put fash fan fashion at three rather than two . and specially it definitely could fits the the real product what was the what's the company name ? real reaction produ i'm not quite , what does that mean ? it still seems definitely fit that so that's like if that's the new age inno innovative type company , then having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is quite high up on . so so it's if we've if we've put in for another special form on button , then they could be different shape . would you mean of you could argue you might do it once year , you would change , because at the moment you're making red apple . like we got cherry one . other ones could be something else shaped . that would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them different seeing as we've got , , we've made it special form , so and that would keep us close on the the fashion type one . and it would , , keep it quite fancy as , . so it's whatever fruit was in fashion next year . so next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as whate whatever , lemon . the volume buttons could be lemons , . and that amount , we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? so , we've what have we what have we rid of . we got rid of the plastic . is it the rubber . that , that was that was just about all . we've , ease has certainly stayed . we've saved quite bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest . so in sense not having that , we've lost some lost something on the innovation side ? but so , we've got we got rid of the rubber case , but we've now we now got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . and that is like the most standard type of button . so in terms of fanciness and fashionability , we're the same , . so , we could put two again on them . and everything else has stayed the same , so , plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use . and what about the innovation ? 've still got the kinetic energy . do you think . the speech feature . and the speech feature . and then , the corporate identity . we've cut just about the same . we've lost hasn't it it's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect but more the the features of the actual control will be more important than than the the actual aesthetics , but but either way , we've made it fairly close to what just the the company logo . how it would play out , . whether whether that's considered to be part of the corporate identity , . don't see how we could make it any more . apart from doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing . but then what colour would you make the r_s ? so there's like set design which we get printed off . but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be stick-on badge . so you're in sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo . and then but you've got the space for it to stick it on . what what what's the company colour ? did you get told what the company colour is or . i'm still not quite we've established that . no , we got the logo off the web browser . but but but in the sense that , as you saw with the windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter . there's virtually the way that you frame , , the windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is , so long as our company's logo is framed in the same way as that with like black outline . fact , they've got black and white or black and silver . so , even if you had silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively double edging on the on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . and that's actually quite sneaky way of doing it . 'cause you've got we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to . you could put in another , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . or would that be . we decided that the blue ones were the the standard colour . so you were talking about we're assuming the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . which may or may not be the case . shall we save the point two for profitability then ? we've for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and , fit the idea of what they want . bu but but was the was there not button that you were thinking of on the on the other opt , on the second page , as it were , that you were thinking of having as different colour ? don't think they would really need to be . if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine . needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as . and then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start . it's the thing that , , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit button quickly to change the channel or volume . so , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . but if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying bit more attention . so it may be different colour buttons isn't so important . so we just add that to profitability in effect . so , so we've dropped the cost , but same function ? so we're meant to finish up in five minutes . just made load of money . shouldn't we lose point on fashion , go to three ? 'cause we've lost the overall spongy feel . 'cause it doesn't seem that it just hasn't changed . but we said that because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra fruit shape on one of the buttons . le lemon sh , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones . did we decide what that was , which button it was ? on the volume ones ? definitely lemon shaped . did did you have to have rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? or was it the other way around ? you had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . so we can we're . so we're this way around . so that so we've saved saved two euros on that . until the design team comes in and says , get off . but you are the design team . then we say it's fine , so it's all good . so what bit are we on to ? can check if that's cherry or an apple ? did we decide against the apple because of apple mac ? and did we make it cherry officially ? just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like . drats , i've botched that , haven't . so were we aiming for certain target on that scale ? we're aiming for one for all of them . but it really has to fit into the budget , so we just have to adjust things to get it in the which is fair enough . and we seem to have least something in each criteria . we haven't completely left anything out , so as an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything . so do we have anything else to discuss ? what's on the agenda ? what's happened here ? so we got so we've done the the finance bit and the excel project and the we've done the redesign . we've got the closing . so we're now on to project process . now satisfaction with , , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . so , we're actually now , in sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is my understanding of it . so what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain . so , so suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which will do . finish your meeting now . we should just go through this quickly and then , . so , have to finish that page . , so project evaluation . so , creativity . did you feel you got chance to express yourselves enough ? some of the divisions though between the individual meetings were bit arbitrary . how do you mean ? we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings , and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , , we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . in you on your own . the only thing you find is in manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to meeting , you decide , , you do this , you do that , you do that . you'd you'd probably present it at one like that . then you go away . you find out information . you then come back . you then discuss it . you then go and change things around , and then go back . so whereas , this time , you're really getting it from database source , so it's not anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant . i've put , seemed . creativity , seemed . flow of information on on any given subject given subject sometimes disjointed . it could have been slightly more creative project . remote control isn't the most fancy thing that you could imagine designing . the thing itself . have could have used different example pel to increase create creativity . 't think of better example at the minute . is this go it kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on . you have to do it within set time frame is the other thing , so but the other thing is that they're i'm guessing that they're trying to use this software to to demonstrate how you could do project . but think like it was bit restrictive just to say that you have to design television remote control , in way . it depends what business you're in , . this one seems . from the website it looks it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's , , fifteen quid . one of those things . like , companies can have like range of products and how it works but that something got sent out and have like brief to . my wife at the moment , , is acting as computer for you normally , you got problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . so what she's doing is she's having to spend day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question . and then you or the idea is that the whichever person's at the other end can point them in the direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the direction , either at the library , or or or come back , or go and see joe bloggs , or whatever . so , and that was project suspect similar to this , because they they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable to enable it to work . and , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong . sh we look at the last slide , see if it's got anything else . so alright , so we've got new ideas found , did we find any , no . there's one one more to go . if you look at their products on their website here , real reaction , it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . it was quite good with this the white board , having that and the digital pens . like , that's something that made it little easier . leadership , teamwork . we did find new idea , kinetic remote control . i've never seen one of them before . does you've got voice recognition computers , that's not remote controls . voice recognition , especially not could . t's different application of it . so it's just like the same products , but just put together in different way . so how do you reckon teamwork went ? we all had separate ideas and then discussed them . that went , . to go reasonably . don't think the budget allowed us to do anything , don't don't fitted in with the rest of their products . bit bit arbitrary . they've got all these , , high definition d_v_d_ and portable seven inch lightweight computer screens , and i'm thinking , do , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . surely they they should produ . so , we're we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . leadership's bit of funny one , isn't it . and and new new ideas found was the the other thing . but we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager . you were the leader . so our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours . now , i'd much rather be in marketing but certainly didn't get this computer to work as as would have liked . however , alright means , so whiteboard so really , it's equipment . comput computers could be bit difficult at times but there's little there's little chi there's little there's little chip , you must plug it into something and it produces . but , don't i'm not see the value in these . they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? where do you get the recording ? do you plug the computer ? so it's not just for us , it's for the experiment as whole , so should we quickly look at the last slide ? you watch video of it . whether it just produces big image of everything you've written , and page after page . new ideas found , so one or two . kinetic powered remote control . what was the other one ? voice recognition thing . and voice , was it voice activated recognition . voice recognition , . to fill in these fill in these questionnaires no . so , are the costs within budget , yes . is the project evaluated , yes . don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . is that everything ? that we've got two questionnaires and report on the last meeting . so we don't re so really tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere .
the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? that's good plan . so we start with you ? my name is francina . and i'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface . and my role is to design television remote control . and i'm marketing person . wanna figure out how to sell them . and your name is ? my name is eileen . my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are deal with the technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design . and as you already am betty . am the project manager for today . so why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do . yes opening , acquaintance , tool training , the tools are , , we already the tool is really our the computer , as far as see . we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there . project plan , that falls under the same heading . don't think we have any discussion at this point . here is what this thing should be . this thing we are gonna design is new remote control . should be original , trendy , and , , user friendly . so you wanna make some notes of that . here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . that is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what we have come up with . the same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . detailed design , same thing . so three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with . functional , conception and detailed . 't write with this thing . we should redesign it . after we've finished the remote control we'll get to that . then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? so that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . you wanna go eileen and whether you without hanging yourself . i'll see what do . see if see if remember how to draw kitty cat or rabbit . and remember you have to press so it works . so that it will record . traditional kitty cat . fat , fat cat . i've very fat cat . and it likes to sit like that . and you're francine , ? yes , i'm francina . would you like like just to see how it feels , so that you have little idea ? am supposed to wipe off that or . in no , no . no , that's . we'll get to that later . what should draw ? i'm going to draw snake . how does it look like ? hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause don't like snakes . here's the project finance which , , we all have to think about when we design this thing . selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro . profit aim for the company is fifty million euro , the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro . that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . so these are all things , , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera . now , the discussion is does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? , using remote control . exp 'cause we we use we use , , everyday . and now having used remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or clearly better marked buttons , , things like that ? yes , feel the remote should be very compact . those which we get here nowadays it's very long . and and it should have multi-purpose . like the remote control which we use for t_v_ , it shou it should be used for some other purpose also , like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . so it should be multi-functional gadget that would control all your household machines . yes , exactly yes . at twelve fifty euros per who knows if we get really good designer we can do that . we certainly can try to agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . it should be something new it should be it it should do something different than than just what we have . now , , the other thing to think there is the design . design should be , it should be different . all the almost all the remotes yes , exactly . like trendy no like for earlier we saw it should be something trendy . ten do , colours and al shapes also . it should different colours or materials or . are different shapes . so shapes , , like kidney shape feels better in your hand , . friendly shape , that would help . another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap , because one of the big things that happens is people lose them . they can't find it . that is true , because they put newspaper or they put it behind plant or , we , whatever . and and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the t_v_ off and they say , where the hell is my my remote control ? so some so , so it's really the beep or , or light should blink . or or if it's really , if it's really in dark spot that it gives out sound or signal . some beep like that , so that we can go . or should ha fluorescent signal , . so if lost if lost signal with throw signal , . it should have light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . exactly , just that's what i'm saying . may not be beep . i'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's beep or whether light or , my my idea is that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in dark spot , meaning like newspaper is on top , sweater is on top or it it's behind plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like , what you call it light sensors , ? beep or it's light , it's light . and do you think good clue for that is that it would respond to clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? in in that moment it has sensor , it it gets certain darkness , it ge has sensor and it gives out signal whether that be light signal or beep , , that we can discuss that later , . probably , probably it's , . so the light sensor would activate the signal . there would be you have to have some sensor and voice or clapping it's not specific enough . know there are the lamps and , , you can clap on and off , but they only work to certain degree and what with , but then those people we can't help everybody . but it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it . , that didn't we can't do it . because you're because you're silly . then , in that case yes . because people are silly . it could be on , if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table , , we have to move along , . we have , we have to move along , but we have some good good points to start with here . the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . you all did you get notices on your computer for this ? so , you got the notice . the working design , that's the function i_d_ who is this ? the industrial designer that's you . it's functional de , exactly , technical . so , we looking for working design when we come back . working design , , it's it's mainly technical-functional design . then and then the technical funct you are the technical function , so so you are the working design . functional design , and you . so you have working design and then functional design . and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . that would be your idea . and , , price . that it , that it , that the price is good price . the price is given , but , that was . we have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price . and , , specifi you you will get specific instructions for that . that's the end of the show . so we have , we have twen two two two three minutes . any questions at this point ? you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions , , you can . have enough to think about 'til our next meeting . how about you people ? even have , , . alright , , very good . so let's see . then we see you in about thirty minutes . and see what we can come up with .
is everybody ready ? i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be with you . take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . you want me to start now ? could you put my slides up 'cause it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time . you're participant four . i'm participant four believe . and now full screen . there we go . we have introduced ourselves , so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why don't we pass to the second slide . and then full screen . that's where my discussion starts . since i'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since have to try to sell it . that the method should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and the reason put that there like that is that in the init in the initial stage should just be open to lots of suggestions . you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should turn on your c_d_ whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility . so i'll be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do . so in the beginning just have big puddle of things that we anybody can throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to to customer we'll try to then prioritise those . so that was what there , and as said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we're gonna sell this thing , the best time to sell it is as christmas present . twenty five euros makes little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and t's , gee gotta have that . and take out their wallet and buy it . so it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by september , 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in september showing it around , isn't gonna sell for christmas . and then i'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of of the features and of the the look and the colour and i'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . so i'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you , and i'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet , what what's what's gonna really be what they call sizzle , 'cause we gotta sell this sizzle . lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever . can we go to the next slide ? alright already did little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . so i'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where was saying we we could suggest anything . i'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have list of things we can cross off , not something like whole house control what'll be and then found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v_ , the v_c_r_ , the stereo set something else cute like coffee pot or one other appliance or lamp . can can at this point interject something ? have to wind up ? we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered . the one thing something to eliminate that's the teletext , because that's outdated with the internet , and according to to higher management the it should only control the t_v_ , mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex task to to to include other things , and they are concerned with the time to market . complicated , , . and the and the third thing that they wanna make that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as product of of of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . so that's something so . so wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with with the things we wanna look at . these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things , so it's only gonna be t_v_ , but the one thing that could be eliminated is the teletext idea . alright , for that . alright now other things that found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . 'cause lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room . so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , we wanna make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the light emitting thing as as beep , and that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . can we go to the next slide ? so , my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . that is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase . because once there's no be-back , sales they always say , be-backs don't come back . if somebody says , i'll come back and get it next week you're dead . they're never gonna come back and buy it . you've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now now is big word in in my book for selling this thing . and , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make it's really intuitive and easy to use . we have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that's why i'm saying , simplicity is good . finding it's important , you can't use it if you can't find it . so we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and i've already said this several times but put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros . so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , twenty five euros i'm not gonna take that . has to be so that they're gonna say , twenty five euros isn't much . and then motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . that's about it for me now . and who would be next , , that would be you . you want me to get your slide show up ? and you are number three ? number two , . can you make it full screen ? no , it's like you you have to press here . the cup cup shape here ? the thir third . so today i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . can you go to the next sli slide ? the metal is like in remote controller you have chip integrated circuit which is like brain of the remote controller . it takes the power from battery say battery it it can be elec an electric supply like you have to like switch connec connect connect your remote controller to power supply from the electricity like that . it should be battery because remote controller should be like you you you should take it to wherever you want and then this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press button it's like input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like t_v_ or air conditioner , something like that so . remote controller is specifically designed to single device . if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with particular frequency the device should the frequency is . it should re re recognise the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press button channel like that then the remote remote controller will send send se send signal , and the t_v_ it should translate that into like change the channel like that , change the volume control and so it's hard to design remote controller for multiple devices . that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook . yo and it's but it's so . so user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be user user in interface like switch pad like that buttons should be there . so you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to mute mute the t_v_ or you want to have child lock or you want to do some operations there's there should be some device to tell what to do to the in integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can send the signals and t_v_ can perform the actions . so can you go to the next slide ? so would like to add some extra features to the remote controller these are the very simple features and they don't take much much of the investment also , it's like el the text or buttons which which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . and ther there should be beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose child is playing with the remote controller and and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be beep saying that it's this this is not action , there can be no action taking to that so . and there should be child lock , like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by child they can't be like you you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . if make it useable for more than one device it's it's hard but it's possible but it so it's it's , , . that has been that has been eliminated , so that's that's unfortunately moot point now . already eliminated that . and different shapes that we can do like we can have all animals shapes or comfortable whi which can fit into your hands and so that , , and colours also , different colours , and no no no , it won't don't will be like , you can have for if you want ther there to be more . now that's good from marketing point of view , the fun the fun shape . it just build mould and . and that you you say that won't add too much to the budget ? to the shape is do you think there's any chance of having ser in having the same machine with the same buttons but several different shapes ? it's it's just shape so it doesn't matter . as the budget we're looking at if you build one mould don't think that's going to make big difference whether it's gonna be square or yes . that is also possible . is that gonna be possible ? 'cause that might help with the marketing . we will have to look at the budget on that but in principle that that would be that would be fun , . that will be . because we had something sexy for adults and we could have something silly for children or little animal shape or in or little elephant so they can remember where it is . silly for children . for children , exactly . like an animal or . like doll , or yes . that's what , . and and the butto buttons also if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . if you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive , so we need to make some buttons which are which are like in in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but it will complicate the matter more so . that that's something that we'll have to discuss with the user interface person because there's lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . because one of the things were complaining about in my what found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn new one . the changing modes was something you and , all all four of us we work with computers all the time , changing modes is nothing for us , but people who and and that's and that's the thing people learn by feel , and you don't feel the mode change . little elderly , little arthritic hand , and and it's small button and and it they don't press it exactly something else happens not their favourite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated . you don't us , usually . so having buttons be various shapes might be help too . shapes also , different shapes . like the triangle is for the volume and square is for changing channels , so that people can develop tactile sense of it . but we'll get to that with you . , and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and so . now that's good point . and display clock if you want more features then we can display clock it don't will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's , and we display clock . that's that's good that's good one , because the clock would be really friendly , and and when is your favourite show coming on and , and lot of time there's not clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for minute . and then you can just see your remote controller so . you're sitting there already or you have no other . that's that's good , the clock is good . can you go to the next slide ? components the main components we need for it ha like buttons and underneath that there should be switch . like we can have bulb like whenever we are operating remote controller or whenever the t_v_ is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have light . then it will be like if you switch on your t_v_ through anoth another source , not from through remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller you can find with the light . we can have that . whenever the t_v_ is on , remote controller will have light . and then infrared bulbs . this is like when it is dark . and battery , there should be battery for power supply , and chip , chip which is like brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is lights , everything , so there should be wires . and there should be case where we can keep all the things and , different shapes or whatever it is there should be case to put to give shape . to keep the remote ? holder remote holder . holder , , . can you move onto the next slide . next sli slide . have referred the site the homepage of the our website , from where have got few points . that's it , that's it from me now . so it we should visit this site and have look at what's up there ? you don't have to . it's not like that , have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so . so it might be helpful if we had look at that . if you want . could you go back to that slide where she had that slide up betsy ? it's actually there now , there on the screen . you are number two ? no no , i'm three . make it full ? would you want it full full screen ? yes yes yes . as user interface designer did little research to find out what are the features which user would like to have on their remote . can you go onto the next slide ? so found out that but the main purpose of remote is to control the function of television at far off distance at remote distance . now for that , remote controller should have switch on off button by which user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t_v_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t_v_ . there should be signal something like radio wave or infrared light or led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . now there should be some timer to set for viewing particular particular programme or switching on and off particular programme according to the user choice . on the on on the remote . so if if he want to view particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the t_v_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time . so he can use that properties of features and then there should be child lock system if particular channel is not to be viewed by particular for certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel . by your child , . and the the and the one of the feature user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t_v_ television . and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of t_ in alphabet for more compactability . and and and it is one more point which noted it down , like the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not any skin disease some al allergy to either children or to ad adult person . and it should have an it can have an alarm clock person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight p_m_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and don't will cost much to set an alarm clock inside remote . if there is clock then there can be alarm clock . and an alarm clock , that should that should be . yes , and as john reece said the buttons can be , can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently . so in even in the dark the user can buttons to use to switch on particular channel . and the design of the remote should be in such way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if child plays with remote , he he should not be harmed in any way . and findings , found out on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are so there you have different types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of television . and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for multipurpose use . not , no like it can it can be used as t_v_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm timing and it should have child lock , and then to save electricity there should not be much move lots of circuits and all that . and if person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it . it's like , it's like timer it's like lock to the television . timer , , , . and then you can use timer as . now have on my slide show we already we have already done the agenda , and on the closing there will be lunch break and all that . however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . and what function , working design , how how does it work . so these are the two things we should come up wit with . so the first thing is pro little easier on who is our target group . in many ways everybody . everybody who has t_v_ . t_v_ television we was . and today there are probably not many people who don't have t_v_ . don't t_v_ , . there are few but in general not . now , talking about the target group which is in sense everybody , but within the target group we have subgroups . we have we have earlier it was mentioned about elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , so that's one group that's certainly important . then we have just the nervous people who can never press little button on anything unless it's really very clear . and how much we want to cater to children's use . that's question whether that's important that children can really use it or not . so this these are just some thoughts have on it , and what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes different buttons for different groups . there's the old motto , children under six never shop alone . so if you've designed something that's very attractive to children the mummy mummy we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has lot of marketing pull . that has lot of that has lot of appeal but i'm i'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups . the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . like you make it and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever , . you can make banana shaped one . but the question is really , who is our target group . do we look at one target group ? and with the twenty five euros can we can we afford to have i'm asking the technical people here whether to look at subgroups with different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ? no generally we can we can design remote which is mainly for people with age from ten to forty and and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes . we can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and . but in family in family there will be aged person , children and middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes . children and everybody , . they would like to buy just one and just one which can be used all the three cost effective . that we can do , but specifically if if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make bi big remote controller so specifically you can design big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in different . what about the electronics ? that's not really gonna change much , is it ? no , it it doesn't cost , . that that that won't change much , will it ? no the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function , and the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons , within the target group or subgroups . doesn't doesn't doesn't matter . the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in sense . the basic design understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons . so that remains to to be seen but the target group as whole is is everybody with t_v_ . and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ? that's that's the question . the same electronics and all that's gonna be different is the plastic case . and in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it ? you as an industrial person ? don't think no . there's there's an idea the new new portable phones ? they have like removable plastic cases , so you can have striped one or you can have fluorescent blue one , or whatever , and something like that , that in each package you have you you have you have you have let's say fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in package . there's real idea . and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately . like for mobile phones we have different covers , like designs and all so that we can have that . and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for few francs or euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours in it . an alternate package . but have doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people . the idea here is to to to design one remote and what the only change is gonna be the funct the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , having larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children five minutes that was tha that's the old message . we can only aff , . warning , finish meeting now . finish meeting now . may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but . but to sum it up the target group is everybody . if we do some more research , we . if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that . seventy percent is unique remote controller and thirty percent is it's like . but we have to , fair enough . do we agree , do we ? do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not . so now understand it's lunch break . so that's what we will do . so hank you very much . and we'll see you after lunch .
how how we doing ? first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given . in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . it's also an item that people lose lot . so we should address that . and , , it should be something that is very simple to use . in addition to that to make it sell , , the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's very important fact , 'cause if they say , , go home and think about it , that won't work . also mentioned was it should be it should have very short learning curve . and it could be sold by using slogan . our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have chip that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls interface that controls the chip . therefore , messages will be controlled in the same manner . there should be extra features like lid buttons , beep . if too many buttons are pressed , child lock and display clock so that people could you could see the time , , what show they want to watch . also mentioned was different shapes . so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and some holder for the for the item . francino who is our interface designer has mentioned that the that it , , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have channel lock . particularly with small children that they couldn't watch channel that is undesirable . it should be compact . her personal favourite was it should be t-shaped . and have an anar alarm-clock . and the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . the different systems that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . it should have electri electrici electricity saving feature . and even possibly timer to so that people can program their favourite program on from the remote . are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? that is it . then we i'm looking for three presentations . and whether the order matters much , don't don't , so whoever wants , . now my slide , . come on , close already . and that's number two , ? now as an interface designer , would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . now the function of remote is to send messages to the television . this messages could be switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine . nine channel switches ? nine channel switches ? yes , nine numbers . and then you have swapping of button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . then it should have next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on scrolling the channels one by one . going to the nex next . next slide , . then you should have button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . then , there should be button which can give subtitles for particular program which is going on television . if you are watching french program and you would like to have subtitles in english , then there should be channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the the subtitles on the screen . then there should there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . now there should be memory switch . there should be mute button . suddenly if if if viewer he gets telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the t_v_ , but he he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can while talking he can watch the t_v_ . now the most important feature would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . it's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . so remote can be can be designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , now the the , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . so the t_v_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . so this is one of the very important feature remote control can have . so this is one one of the interface which can be created . very simple interface which has all the important features . then , , next slide . then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . so sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . so you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly . even kid can use that . so can you go on to the next slide . so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . and this has multi-purpose use , it can be used for t_v_ , it can be used for cable-satellite , it can be used for v_c_r_ , d_v_d_s and audio . and this has in-built voice recogniser . can you go on to the next slide ? now this is an interface for chil for remote which child can use . this is user-friendly , it's very attractive and children can use it as as they can play with it . and this comes with different colours , different shapes . and this this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface . next slide , . now this is big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace . could lose that in minute . so this is no this is very big , you cannot misplace it anywhere . so this is jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose . this this is one such interface which can be created . and the personal preference would be spe to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user's voice for particular function . any comments on her presentation ? looks like we still have quite choice of things out there . what i'm no suggestion's bad . but we're gonna have to narrow it down little more . don't think that we can get the t-shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , it's just funny . don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter . no , the these are her presentations , but as far as the decision making we getting to that after after but if wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation . it's it's gonna be little bit too unwieldy . have to come back to that later . no , her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options . ho who wants to go next ? the next one , . it's it was the old one . the components design . this time i'm i'm going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . can you go on to the next slide , . have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction . the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera , it's like it can be plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just , , if you if it falls down , then it doesn't break . so it should be strong . and there are no harmful materials used in that . and it should be recyclable . and , , and also using of colouring compon components like if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so we have to use some colouring compone compone components . and the second important thing is integrated circuit . which we can use highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . if it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be like the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have highly sophisticated one . and it should be resistant to high as as low temperatures . suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should be able to re resist the temperature highs and high temperatures and low temperatures . and it should be with equipped with timer and alarm facility . and the other component we should we have in the remote controller is resistor which is like it is very very much important for the electricity flow through through through the remote controller and also capacitor which is which is it's it's like battery , capacitor . can you go on to the next slide , ? diode , transistor , resonator , these are all this technical electri electronic compons components which are which we have to use in remote controller . battery , would like to suggest one thing if we if we will be able to make res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for high performance battery , even if it is low performance battery it ca it can't it can't charge much . it it it's not high voltage battery . then also we can if it is rechargeable one , then people can use it for long time , so in that way we can cut cut the cost , but that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . and we we have circuit board in remote controller . can you go to the next slide , . and how it works , how the remote controller works . when you press button . when you press button , when you do that , you complete specific connection that means when you when you press button there will be small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed . it pros produces mors morse code line signal specific to that button . every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . suppose the user has pressed butto button one , then it will have spe the circuit will generate specific morse code to that that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light . like you have got signal by pressing button . that's morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . that is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l_e_d_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . the sensor on the t_v_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will it will know which what what action it has to do . then it will do the appropriate action . so this is how the remote controller works . can you go to the next slide , . have few pictures . when you look at the remote controller it's it's it this is normal remote controller . and to the next slide , . and where we had few buttons and all . and if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also capac capacitor , three resistors and also resonator , and di and diode transistor . the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like chip and diode transistors an , di can you can see the t_a_ double one eight three five labelled chip . you can also see the the green two green things are these are they are they are resistors , and just beside that you can see transistor , and cylinder shape , that one is capacitor . and also there are resistors , ther there is diode . can you go go on to the next slide . so this is the circuit board . the green one is circuit board . actually , building circuit bo board is pretty pretty easy and also it's it's inexpensive . it's it costs less than what you print on paper , because when you when you are building some circuits some circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing , because you can build these circuit boards on on bulk and it's just printing , nothing like , , you don't need to use wires and all . it's not exactly wires we are using . it's just printing something on board . tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci circuits . so that green thing is circuit board , and also you can see there are like access for buttons , like when you press button , the circuit under the button will be activated it will it will he get some signals from it and it will it will ch its ch se send signal signals to the , , integrated circuit . can you go to the next slide , . so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . can you see the black , round marks ? they they are the circuits . and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . but push-button requires simple chip underneath it , but whereas scroll wheel requires normally regular chip which is higher price range . like for scrolls we have to go for sophisticated and and full complete chip . and as energy source we offer basic battery , more ingenious hard dynamo , kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . so that also we can have in battery , or we can use solar sells . the product can be de delivered into different cases . usually , the cases and card flat that we see usually normal remote controller . and you have more pictures . we have five minutes to the end of the meeting . have just one more slide , . like we can have ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we can't use . and also for electronics we can use simple and regular re or an advanced chip on the print , also infra it includes the infrared se sender . the for the movie just to develop samples and so spe sample speaker . an , that's it . it's all for me now , . any particular comments by anybody ? on the scroll and the push-button , ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing button ? no , no , no , the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for sw switches like buttons or scrolls , which which we used to do before ten ten years before , . now , nobody uses that because you need you need sophisticated chip and all . so it's better we go for ordinary buttons . we'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost . we don't have lot of time left and we will still have to make decision , and the marketing expert has to present her her thing . go to my first my next slide . alright , my method is i'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so i've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . spend lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing . and then when i'm out in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , try to notice what remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation ask about it . and would encourage you all to do the same . and my findings from this is that , , small is beautiful . people like something that really fits in their hand . simple is beautiful . they don't want to have to squint at small print , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want as few buttons as possible , and they don't care for the mode thing . they want each button to do something . and eye-catching is important . it's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . go ahead , i'm trying to finish fast for you . and our preference is , as far as i'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . ours has to be look really and it has to come out before the others , so that we have leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item . and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . if we try to tell people it has too many features , the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . so we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , , that we gonna say are really about our our our new product . and i've been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular . and in my research this year found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . they are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with little cloth on them . so those are things we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item . that concludes the presentation of everyone . and what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote . and so what do we think on the concept of the remote ? you wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours bit ? yes , would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser . so speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ? this could be one feature which could be sellable . that could that could that could be our star feature . that that be really good , , agree with that . but but what i'm very very much doubtful how how far it will work , because speech recogniser like it it has its own problems , issues . it's not distance problem it it's recognising person's voice , like different people will be having different voices , so it like it's everything so so to get good recogni recognising system , it's costly thing , . you you teach you have to teach , before we get too far off here , the components of the concept is the energy . no , it's it's , , it it's like your recording of all question already , and then you're expecting an answer from , you have t_v_ system , i'm the user and my family members are the user , will already record question like , good morning , like around eight o'clock want to see the news in the television . so i'll say just good morning and the t_v_ will switch on . it will recognise my voice and will switch on . what energy do we foresee ? battery , and we all on that . that that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing . then chip on print . and the case . and we all agree on the case , we wanna have something bright , colourful . bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong . and also strong . trendy design and compact . trendy design , compact and strong . user interface concept , interface type , supplements . that will be your area , , jana . like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface . and not what they mean by supplements . and supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have mute button or swapping button . that , or or like her speech recognition would also be supplement . her speech recognition feature would be supplement . so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is . our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the i_d_ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and the u_i_d_ is supposed to come up with the user interface design , and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . in this phase , the two of you , jana and francine , have to work together on prototype using modelling clay , it says here . you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches . if you have any questions , , you you can always contact me or or your coach , suppose . wherever they're hiding ? so we conclude the meeting here and we come back in thirty minutes , according to our timetable here .
hi everyone again . like before we have to redo the meetings from the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go . it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages to the t_v_ . it should have nine channel buttons , next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . it should have memory switch , mute button in case the telephone rings . speech recognition is one of her very favourite personal features she would like see to be integrated in this in this new remote . should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful with star shaped or other shaped buttons . she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose . and she was challenged on that point . but her very personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see speech recogniser integrated in this remote . the industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue . she would like special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . she would like to see timer and or alarm facility integrated . technically this thing would also have resistor and capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible rechargeable battery . and circuit board . and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the to the generat to the generator amplification and the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is feature to to to consider . she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with simple chip scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . should be battery operated and she would have the special cases . the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used her personal observations to come up with the fact that such remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . from her point of view one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . to do that one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home . it should have fruit and vegetable design and should have soft feel . she feels that's really what people want today . and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is speech recogniser , the energy should be battery should be on chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype . just the look like , the button part i'll explain . so this is our what we have made . this is model of the remote control which we are going to build . this is us in snail shape so it it is attractive and it's it's blue in colour bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is looks-wise it is beautiful . and also compact in shape . and also it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . you used to have all the buttons that's good , no , that's and friendly . and the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and which which is strong and also for the the material is plastic and for the buttons it is soft rubber and als . because you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . and then for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is fluorescent green and it's it is bulb like an ordinary infrared . and and the button button's part will be explained by francina . now the we decided upon including certain features on our remote . now these features includes the signal emitting signal it's the led or l_e_d_ the infrared . now we have included the switch on and off button . now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model . then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels . we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . now our our model also contains button which is called as the menu button . menu menu , one one . yes , menu at the centre we have included button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness of this picture . of the screen . we have also included button which is called as the swapping button . now this is special , special feature which we have included . now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the it will take to the next channel . it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is swapping button . the next channel in the numeric pattern , or , . no , swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . and at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly . so this is our proposed model . now the marketing expert has to give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective . what what really like lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , that you can really hold it in one you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with small hand , ? yes , yes . yes the buttons are all raised , ? the buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , really like that . are raised , . or have two hands to operate it , . you really did good job on that , my little designers . and like the idea that the on-off button is in really prominent place . that's that's really good good thing . yes , and it sticks up so that you really you don't have to first go like here it's on and , . the colour's very attractive . the these buttons around here are the mute and these on both sides they're mute ? no , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . yes , yes . so you can push either one ? so if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter . and this brings the menu up on the screen ? this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are . this is the menu yes , yes . the the these these two are to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to scroll the programme channels . scroll up or scroll down the channels . it looks looks like something sell . and now i'm supposed to . have one question will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from piece of paper which button does what ? yes , it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . will have symbols so that that that the user really knows and doesn't have to first learn it . yes , which can be easily recognised . good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent . but anyway it would ha it has to have some of symbols , text so that people kn . we can text . symbols on it . text that we can have on the case itself , we can it will be printed on the case and symbols as as the buttons . just wanted make of that . and and one more feature is we we have holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . for the snail , , , we have the snail shell . yes , yes . so it is , shell . yes , snail shell . he goes back into his shell . we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some little comic effect on our marketing about how this is rapid snail like that that would , that would really work . now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? so voice recognition is our big selling point 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range . that's really the voice recognition that's really unusual and then , and then the other thing would be sh shape or practicality of use . that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance . we're really gonna have the be the cutest remote control on the block . so we have to play with the image , play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition . those are the two things to push . the look and the voice recognition . they're gonna be our two selling points . now having said that no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done . i'm supposed to make little presentation , aren't ? now we're gonna talk about financing . but in my instructions it said was supposed to go to the board and do something . there is production evaluation . is that you ? but that's after the financing . we had looks and voice recognition . now on the financing we bring up the there it is . energy source we say that's battery , ? so we we use one . cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . she told me could just ch change it here and then it would it doesn't work . can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? , , let's see . kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need . electronics , simple chip on print ? is that's what we're using ? one of those ? regular chip on print . that's all we need , the one case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved . it's double curved . one of those ? case materi supplements . plastic we said , ? wood , rubber ? rubber , because we're gonna have the soft buttons . but , yes but that's just for the case material , so special colours though , we having that , ? that is for rubbers that is case material . is this for the case ? the , mm' . and then we have to interface push buttons . scroll wheel , no . integrated scroll wheel , l_c_ display ? no , 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , ? button supplement special colour ? speci yes yes we do have special form . and special material , rubber , wood , yes . total seven point six whatever that means . that's the price . that's the price . one two three four five six seven eight nine nine points , , yes . it is it just . eight , eight point two . eight point two , ? so , we looks like we are within budget . should save this suppose , ? on the desktop . my documents , computer . my compu here it is , yes . ami should for . good , so that's the good news . we gonna be popular . so that financing was pretty simple . now we would like to have presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation . i'll take my file down so you can bring it up . should be able to get it now . why don't you move just to the next slide away . you wanna go to the next slide ? my method for the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? and we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that little things we haven't thought of . we can't accept every suggestion , but we just need to get few . and show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . so we have to get some input from those people . and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and we like it , we t's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . now the things that was thinking and my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . wanted the shape to be biomorphic , didn't want anything with angles and all square , wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that . the size is small , the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's . and functionality put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . they don't have television in the store , they can't play with it . so they'll be our main selling points . so those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide . so the shape is one . that's really , really excellent shape . the size is small and these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't in how feel . that it's that it's plenty small enough to sell but we're the scale is one to seven . we're in the middle as far as other competitors . and our colour is . the colours are bright and warm and we really do job there . and given the constraints that we had we got it as soft as possible . and then functionality you did really good job on functionality , we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so would say that we got to five out of seven on on functionality . so that we've got product and we can get off and running with it . realised one thing . in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . and how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too . we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ? eight , eight twenty , yes . eight twenty so we have four euros , . and so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend . maximum we have another four point three euros four thirty . but we have no way of presenting that to management as as finished , as finished product and saying with the voice recogniser that costs so much . so we just have to beware of that . and know whether the four thirty will really cover that . as we today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . yes , yes . and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway . as we've seen with so many of these kinds of products . i'm to interrupt then but recog remembered that there was no that that was not included that there was no room for any special features , ? , even my , shape is one . so to beware of that . you wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ? isn't this my last slide ? yes it is . that was my last slide , . and i'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . and we're supposed to talk about those things as team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . i'm i've forgot to do that , . wh why you need that up ? because 't remember what put on there . now i'm supposed to see how long my leash is here . you can make it there . so now we're all supposed to say what we think . so on shape gave it one . what would you ra one being good and seven being the worst . what do you think the shape is ? one , , and be betsy ? yes shape is one . and how about on size ? on size gave it four , , feel it's just average . you you gave it four . would give it at least two . even it is one . it's quite small . you're the designer , you wanna give it one . and then how about how we doing on colour ? colour , gave it one . really like all those bright , warm colours . like the colours . one , one , one , . and how about the feel ? taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand . would give it two . gave it three , two , ? i'll give three . and the next is functionality where admit was little hard on our team here , but . t's also you can't really try it out the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but i'll give it three . it looks like we've got got ourselves pretty good product . the functionality's the only place where we have to think about , heaven forbid , having another meeting . but otherwise we're we're ready to go to go with this product . anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? here is what we looking at satisfaction on room for creativity . is there more room for creativity or are we happy ? we can , include some more buttons and features . we can always improve , yes . yes , features . we can make the buttons few buttons smaller . they are quite big , so we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . if we want to have more features than that . then again if we're gonna do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . so that that's where we're gonna have to do we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . definitely , , two mu mute buttons . and then we can do something with the the volume control . we can put on one button . and couple of other comp consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . al always bearing in mind that now we are within the budget and that we still we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just add whole lot of more things . we need we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser . so the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? personally i'm pretty happy . i'm pretty happy with it too , , it's something market . even i'm happy . an and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? and team work was very very good , we really . you've done good job , miss leader . yes , yes you've done good job . do too we worked together as team , . and we are we happy with the means we used ? we used whiteboard , we didn't use digital digital pens are these things . we could've used the whiteboard little bit more , , we didn't use that enough . whiteboard more , yes , yes . yes , we could . it's not in the best position in the room like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and from that point of view we ignored it little bit . and we used the slide because it was better positioned . yes , so , , and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it little easier . did we new did we find new ideas ? we were we were very good , , . we we did , in more than one respect and so we did very here . are the costs within budget ? yes , yes . is the project evaluated ? yes , yes . cel celebration yes , yes . today we have apple juice and after we sell million of we have champagne . so all very much . this was very good and we did come up with new product that's feasible . feasible from the production point of view and feasible from marketing point of view . watch have my cord behind you here . do we do we have some time left ? you have , alright . they say it's forty minutes . but we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished . it'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace . there we go .
so good morning . see you all find your places . is everybody sitting on the place ? so let's see . first will introduce myself . if if everybody knows me , so i'm bart , hello . my name's frank . let's start off with little presentation . now first i'll tell you little bit about the setting . you can see there are few cameras here . they'll record our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . there are also some microphones there but you don't have to pay lot of attention on those , because it will disappear when you don't attend to it . so is there project documents folder ? there are some notes in it already see , some documents . i'll start with the presentation kick off . is being modified by the administrator . let's do it read only . if you've noticed , but we're working for real reaction . it's company in electronics . we put fashion in electronics , we make it work , we put lot of effort in design and in the product itself . i'm bart the project manager so i'll direct you through the project . this is our agenda . we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . sit down , then take some notes or let's see . you can take the minutes once in while . it's not lot of work , but just if you hear something you can write down , just write it down . as you can see it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . aquaintance is point we've done bit . have you all seen the corporate website already ? have you seen any flaws in it ? can't say paid much attention to it , but . see if it works this way . no , it doesn't work here . but on the corporate information side there's there was real remote instead of real reaction . real remote is not really the company we're we are , but it's just little fault . what are we going to do ? our project aim is as you can see new remote control . it has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . so these are the points why we also hired you . we've got the marketing expert for the trendy and user friendly look . and industrial designer there's also user friendly and bit original . and we've got our user interface designer . he's also that's about the new remote control . project method is there are three phases we are going through . first is functional des design , individual work , meetings . after the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . had some role indications on here . but it already by yourself . the industrial designer is going to work on the working design , components design and bit of the look and feel design . the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . and the marketing expert is doing little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project product ev evaluation . so that's bit what you're going to do . but that will be all worked out in other meetings . then we've got our first tool training . we are going to work with lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have little bit of training first . as you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . in the white board here there's little tool bar on this side . here are some functions . you can save . these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo little piece of drawing . blank new document for each person . select pen , eraser . capture we don't have to do anything with . then we've got our pen . it's really funny because you can draw with it on this page in the is form of . you can also select the current colour and the line width . but then first you have to select the pen function . but we're going to work with it in minute . that's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings on there . then short thing about documents . we've got our shared folder , project project what was it ? but all you will found that already because there are lot of documents in it already , so it will be . and these are available on the smart boards as , so if you have document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . here is simple tool bar . it's what said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . you can switch between the different drawings . and then we're going to try out the white board . so as you can see we all going to draw animal . just to just to get bit familiar with it . mouse wasn't running away . that was interesting . is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ? we're going to draw animal . and just sum up few of its favourite characteristics . the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . there's start from now . you can use this pen by holding it like like little child . because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good . another thing is you have to be bit slow . 'cause if you're going to draw like really fast then the pen won't hold up . so we choose form of current colour grey is appropriate . then the line width . seven will be . now you'll see my drawing capabilities . these are not very much , but , see you have to do it real slow . was trying to draw dolphin , but his nose has to be little bit but it's close . i'm thinking about swordfish . so what it's this is bit of the swordfish . he hasn't got an eye . now we've got another function . we've got the eraser . and then you can undo this easily . and i've got to write down few of its characteristics . is they've got no text tool , no . this is typically undo action , . you have to hold it bit upside-down . that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be stripe . but , i'm just trying . this is not my work , . you have to use . it's it wants to draw another animal ? it lives for the fun . so it's my characteristic characteristic about the dolphin . it lives for the fun . so now i'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . gonna use different line width . and i'm gonna draw in black . i'm not much of an artist , but here we go . it's easier to draw the smaller line width , . because this is going lot better than did . this is my . with little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts . it's real dead sheep , . for recognition , , see . you can also write your name somewhere . they are come on . you have to go really slow when you're writing . they're brilliant animal animals . and that's just little me thingy . i'll pass the pen to our user interface designer . i'm just gonna draw its head , but let's see . what that is ? you say blank , or . just blank sheet . was gonna draw cat too , so . i'll just try something else . something different than garfield . mine is bit more skinny . it's pretty skinny cat . but , it's supposed to be cat . and the most interesting tail . is your cat , or did you find him on the street ? like cats because they are independent . that's pretty clear . so everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? so if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . it's pretty easy . haunted white board . we're being haunted . so we've got the tool introduction . we move along to the project finance . as you can see , we for our remote control , selling price is twenty five euros . our selling price . our profit aim is fifty million euros . that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . we can do it international , so we have to focus on different users , different cultures , and different trends as . but that's all in the later stadium . our production cost can be maximal twelve and half euros , so that's also point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and like that . it won't work . so just try to remember these points . selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . and production cost maximal twelve and half euros . so that's leads us to our little discussion . we've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . so i'm gonna sit down , . you got message . i've got message . five minutes , . that's good timing . so just on side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me black screen ? you have to say the magic word . does it do anything ? you have to just clap it down ? back up again . no slide show . it's off now . now you have to put it back . you'll be , . it was on , but , there we are . t's those laptops . but so does everybody has experiences with remote controls , and not the ordinary mote controls , but also little bit different ones ? like you can use for other ? we have broad t_v_ at home , and d_v_d_ player , so we got like lot of remote controls , one for the t_v_ , one for the video recorder , one for the d_v_d_ player . no , me neither . and it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . i've i've got one at home . and you can program eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . and it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or or second floor . so that's pretty handy when you have video recorder or d_v_d_ player downstairs and you've got link to your t_v_ on the second floor . so that's pretty handy thing . but only the that if you can put different devices in one remote control , it makes it lot easier as . it's that's good to remember . so you can take minutes again . since it's your job . so we've we want different functions and we can see if we can do something with the infra-red . but if that will exceed the production costs . so that that's something we have to find out , . but that would be really good if we could do that . and other functions for remote control ? we can make it shock proof . has to be shock proof 'cause my remote control tends to fall lot . waterproof , or , you never no know , . so , one other little thing . so these are our few things we can think of . will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder . thought it might be handy to put battery status display on it . so you can see how much is left in the battery . that's battery stays . but they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too . but just little led , . that's an idea as . they were all mentioned , so . any questions about this presentation ? kick off presentation . nope , don't . then i'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work . finish meeting now . and we can all work on our own projects . then i'll meet you in about half an hour , . half an hour . so good luck .
everybody found his place again ? so this is our second meeting . and still failing ? now we're going into the functional design . important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . so that we can move onto the second phase . but first this phase . first an announcement . there's little adaptation in the air conditioning system . so there's our ghost mouse again . that that means that you can have little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that's because of this it's in wing c_ and . so it should be over in in while , couple of days . but it's going to be cold anyway , so don't think you're gonna need it . then our agenda . now first the opening . this time will take the minutes . you're going to have presentation . all of you . and we've got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations . so suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me . and then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . so we've got forty minutes for all of it . so suggest let's start with the first presentation . who wants to be first ? 'll go first . so just it's easier if you you will tell your presentation as . just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about . my name is freek van ponnen . i'm the market expert . but you already knew that . i've done some research . we have we have been doing research in usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls . we let them fill out questionnaire . we had one hundred of these test subjects . in addition we did some market research . see what the market consists of . what ages are involved . these are three quite astonishing results , . remotes are being considered ugly . seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on fancy-looking remote control . so in addition remotes were not very functional . fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on remote control . and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . so some things . then we did some research to the most relevant functions . channel selection and volume selection both got ten on scale of one to ten for relevancy . the power button got nine . and teletext got six and half . so these are the most most important functions on remote control . then there are some one-time use function . that's what like to call them . that audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . then these are the this is the market . sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty six . main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . they like to use new new functions . but they also are very critical . they won't spend their money very easily . so the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market . they are not really very interested in features . but they do tend to spend their money lot easier . what this indicates for our design . we should make remote for the future . and this means we would have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . this would mean we would have to make fancy design . the results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r_s_ r_s_i_ . this is certainly something to take into account . and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn how to operate new control , remote control . so these are two factors that should be included in the design . besides that the remote must look very . and the functionality as lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , we should make very few buttons . this will also be beneficial to the design of the remote . the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons . 'cause they're used most and so they should be robust . they shouldn't break down easily . then as mo as lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room , it might be and say might be because it would certainly boost the production costs lot . but it might be good idea to make docking station . and this would , could get button in it which would send signal to the remote which would then beep . so you'd know where it is in the room . and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . then surprisingly deal of people indicated that an screen in the remote control would be preferred . this was mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . but up till forty five it remains feasible . this would also greatly increase the production costs but these are just some small factors we could consider . that would be all . so anybody have any questions until now ? about functional requirements ? now to the second . i've been looking at the user interface of it . for the techno functions of of it . you can take your time . we've got plenty of time , so . you should go to the top thingy . there it is . we must use the general functions of the remote control . i've do i've done little research on the internet and not much information about it , about interface but i've been thinking about simple manner to put lot of functions in one in one remote control . so you've got lot of devi devices like d_v_d_ television , stereo . so but it must be user-friendly . so you you can't put lot of functions in one . in one remote control . got many functions in one remote control , but you can see , this is quite simple remote control . few buttons but this re remote control got lot of buttons . people don't like it , so what was thinking about was keep the general functions like they are . so like the on-off button . keep it like red button . everybody everybody knows it so you don't have to change that . my personal preferences . use display for specific functions of the different device . so wh what was thinking about was you've got this the remote control and you got here the general functions , like the on-off button sound and here you've got display . so you got general the functions of the device for d_v_d_ player or so the pl for playing reverse . and you got here real buttons for selecting device . so this button is for d_v_d_ or so for every device you've got part display of part buttons . so you you never got all the buttons on one device . so that's my idea about it . and let's see . and the buttons the real buttons we have to use . we better use quite large buttons for . everybody have to use it so ol even even old people young people . so we must keep buttons quite simple and quite large . that was my part of it . anybody has questions about the technical functions ? if we are gonna use touchscreen we're gonna go way above the twelve and half euros . you got quite cheap touchscreen . it's not in colour . it's just one colo . seen something on the internet not today but few weeks ago . you got quite an touchscreen and it's for twenty euros or less . so it's possible . would certainly make fancy design . but the it wouldn't be very robust . so that is true . it's very fragile and you can get scratches on it . we would have to look into that . we can first listen to your presentation ? and then we have little discussion about the requirements and design . it's going to it's not too much . i've got presentation about the working design . first about how it works . it's really simple . everybody knows how remote works . the user presses button . the remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send signal to the t_v_ . the t_v_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . so we've got the the plate . it gots conductive disks for every button . when the user presses button , signal got sent , goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v_ . it's very simple device , technically speaking . so this is schematic overview . you've got the buttons . the power source . and when button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . the chip controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps normal bulb . when you press button you can actually see your pressed button . we should use default materials , simple plastics . keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . and you only have to design remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . so it's , in my idea , it's it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in in the product itself . now hope everybody has little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing now . i'm the project manager so i'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements . that's , we've got to design remote which is only suitable for t_v_ . that's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it for more functions . so it has to be simple . another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be thing of the past . and it's function we don't need in our remote control . internet is also mentioned in function we can use . also on televisions it will be available as . another one is the customer is forty plus . that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . this is bit pity for the marketing expert . because he was aiming on the the younger persons . so we have to find market which is above forty plus but which will suit our remote control , and the other way round . and we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product . so it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . and we have to be very clear on this point as . so suggest let's have discussion on the control functions . so is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ? we can see if we can find way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . against the no teletext ? 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . and new t_v_s will have internet access on them . but if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have t_v_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . so it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . i'm against it . it's it is standard remote . besides that , the market for forty plus is like pretty small . but if if see this , it's we're just gonna go for another pretty and not innovative remote control . no we can we can do lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned . if we put lot of effort in those , we can make remote control with just two or three buttons . or just remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . and if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . yes but it's not the biggest part of the market . and besides that , they're not very critical so they don't really care what the remote control is like . they'll just take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . but don't you think that if we make remote which is typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the the device i've looked for although didn't realise it . so let's try it . that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they they want to have fancy remote control . people of forty plus , they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it's with them . that if we're if we put our marketing we can sell this just like if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ? so haven't heard of it . it's big success . if we if we make remote control just with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , . very big success . we don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . we just change our focus on the project , and we can we can sell this . simply think that the new products we are gonna make , spef specifically design , are designed for younger people , so we can focus ourself on the elderly people . and we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls . 'cause what you told is the channel selection is important . volume selection , power and teletext . no we we haven't voted yet , so teletext can be can be function as . but the board tends to disagree . but only if if it won't higher the the cost , because if it will be lot more money to implement teletext as , but don't will be problem . or is teletext . but deaf people need teletext for for subtitles . it'd definitely be bad idea not to include teletext . is anybody really against teletext ? just that , that we just keep the teletext . that's good idea as , especially for the subtitles . we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control , if we make button ex for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . for elderly people they can think , wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles . that's good idea . so teletext can can be very useful in our advantage . functionality should be few buttons , you said . that's very important we have few buttons . so to keep it simple . but don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause might be . if it's only for televi . but it , if it's only for t_v_ you're not gonna need lot of buttons anyway . you need one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but if you if you only nah . but do you need but do you need the buttons for one to zero . so we can we can skip the display , so we don't need it . we can we can use no , we can implement the scroll button ? you're gonna include teletext you do . many people like to use that . 'cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times . or joystick like ? there are other ways too . just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has scroll button which is very useful in searching names or . that's true but don't think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast . and so you would need like the t_v_ would need an function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . and if many channels would do have that . if many t_v_s have that . and besides that it's if we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . they're not used to using scroll buttons . so perhaps we should stick to the basic layout . they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it's too much we can reconsider it . but there won't be very much buttons . or there don't have to be lot . but don't think if you're gonna make remote control only to operate t_v_ , you there's not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible . 'cause there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate t_v_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . don't think there's much to be gained in that area . the number of buttons ? it's very important in the in the design . you can make very fancy design with putting the buttons on the places . and if you have less buttons you can do lot more with to operate only the t_v_ . that is true but there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making remote control only for to operate only the t_v_ . 'cause if you have remote control only to operate t_v_ there's simply not lot of buttons required . there's not lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have lot of buttons either . so it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . so we can . that would that would cost big marketing expedition which was one of the arguments to make it only for the t_v_ because we didn't have the time to market lot . so you suggest we could better focus on the docking station . like other functions . instead of of less buttons . mean we need good way to position all the buttons and but don't think we should spend very much time in that . do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ? it should be possible yes . 'cause it can be no . if it's not too fancy . and if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible . because that's that's good advantage point as . if we have fancy-looking docking station or very that's requirement . so we're just gonna focus on the extras ? we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in like to have extra in new remote control . that's good point . you said they easily get lost as . yes fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . so we should implement the audio sign , . that was what suggested . like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes it makes sound . you have it on you have it's on some phones too , which have docking station . and you just press button and the phone goes ringing . so audio signal should be possible as . so where it is . it's not too expensive . another point is the screen . if that will rise the cost too much , because . we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause it's don't think they have different television sets in every country . it will be too much as . since lot of people indicated that new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have hard time understanding new devices , it might be good idea to have just little screen on it , which would explain button if you press it . which would tell you what it does . and it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or very expensive screen , but just small screen with two . just the normal screen . that's good idea . so some extra info . that's good idea as . but if that would that would fit into the costs . as the small screen . extra button info . that should be possible as . let's see what did we say . should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . few buttons , we talked about that . docking station , . and default materials . that's good idea as , because elderly people don't mind if it's titanium cover or just plastic one . so that doesn't really matter . so we nee let's specify the target group . probably elderly people would be little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters . because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . because what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , . what do we want ? that would be if we should do something like that it would be , it would be really good for for the image of the company . if we want with the the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people . and , there would be good market for it . so that's the now you're talking about sixty to eighty . if we're able to really bring an innovative product . the really but i'd have to look into that little more . and different cultures . we've got five minutes left just now . and with the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . you could we it would be lot easier to adapt it to different cultures . in different languages , . or you have to put language button in it , but that will be bit unnecessary . it's better to put it on different markets with it all . so that's the the target . then few small things . will put the minutes in the project project document folder . what we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept , user interface designer the user interface concept , and the trend-watching . so just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , requirements , and the trends which are going on . and specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach . so for this meeting . and we have lunch-break now . so that's good thing .
this is our third meeting already . hope you enjoyed your lunch . this is the second phase we're going to discuss today . it's the conceptual design meeting . and few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components . conceptual specification of design . and also trend-watching . these are hopefully the points you addressed in your pre presentations you're going to show me in few minutes . but first i'll show you the agenda . first the opening . then we have three presentations . after that we have to come to decision on remote control concepts . how we're going to make it . and then we're closing . we have about forty minutes . so suggest let's get started . did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? then little thing about the last meeting . these are the points we on . the requirements and the target market . requirements are teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that button information . and we are going to use default materials . does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? these are just the the things we thought of , so if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . and we can work it out . and we're going to target sixty to to eighty year old customers . so now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , suggest let's get started with the presentations . so shall we keep the same line-up as last time ? i'll start off then . i'm gonna inform you about the trend-watching i've done over the past few days . we've done some market research . we distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . and besides that deployed some trend-watchers to milan and paris to get all of the newest trends . and i've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . these are some overall findings . most important thing is the fancy design . the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . by innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls . about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . for our group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty years old , this is , these factors are slightly more equal . these are some more group specific findings . the older people prefer dark colours . they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is the material for older people . this is , this image will give you little bit of an impression about the look-and-feel that the remote should have . this leads us to some personal preferences . the remote control and the docking station should blend in in the in the room . so this would mean no eye-catching designs . just keep it simple and the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the these would be the innovativeness in the remote control . so this would be very important that we at least include these features . the trend-watchers consulted advised that it should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . so you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . this is not really this is new shape to older people . so they would prefer design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . so it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . besides that we would advise to bring two editions , one with wood-like colour and feel , and one with grey-black colour . the wood-like for the more exclusive people . people with more money . the grey-black colour for people with less means . that would be all . any questions about the the trends ? we go on to the next one . some research about designing of an interface . the last meeting we had about using few buttons . so that's what what want to to do in our design . so finding an attractive way to control the remote control . the found some something about speech recognition . so we can use that . and using little display . just we have just to focus on the primary functions . so only buttons for sound , for on-off , shifting up sa ca channel or down shifting down . and we need some new attractive functions which attract people for using it . so it's like speak speech recognition and special button for selecting subtitles . just what we mentioned last meeting . and overall user-friendly . so using large large buttons . it's possible to to make quite cheap system for speech recognition . you can think about when you lost your remote control , you can call it and it gives an sig signal . and and for shifting up sen ch channel or for putting out sound , you can just give sign say sound off or and . television put the sound off put the sound off . was thinking about the special button for subtitles , just one button to keep it simple . one push on the button you get small subtitles . double push push , if double click , so you get big subtitles , for people which who can't read small subtitles . so and we have to keep in general buttons so we've got the buttons we have to use . the on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , the numbers , zero to nine . the general buttons more general one button for shifting up and shifting down channel . also we want to use little display for for displaying the the functions of the buttons . and we can build in function which shows the channel or some which the television is on . so made little picture of it . just we can put the on-off button over in this corner , almost all remote controls are using on-off button on that place . so people will recognise the button . so display of it , it's just small display . you can put it on top . it's most place where people , most of looks at . so and special button for shifting up and shifting down channel , it's on place where the thumb of of the so you you can easily shift up or shift down . it's quite handy place . so and all the functions for subtitle one button , for sound and for our design , we have to discuss about it so the form of it so and that's it . about the components design . for the energy source we can use basic battery or , as an optional thing , kinetic energy , like in watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . but if we choose for that option , the docking station would become obsolete . so don't t's really an option . for the casing , the manufacturing department can deliver flat casing , single or double curved casing . it's really up the the design that we're gonna use . it's doesn't imply any technical restrictions . as case supplement , we could , of that later , rubber belt , like anti-slip . for the buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . and the chip-set , it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an screen . and as the trend-watcher presentation showed , people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . form should follow function overall . the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . but depends on what we want . we should disc discuss that . for the case , the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . and the chip-set really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be simple remote control . and that's it . so that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . so these are the points we have to discuss . first we can talk about the energy source , since that's has pretty big influence on production price , and image . so first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , . yes there there are four options . we could use the basic normal battery . but don't think that's really an option . you don't wanna swing before you can watch television . but not every room is very light so it's not very good option . or the kinetic energy . and how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? you shake your remote , and then it powers up . you just you use it and it works . personally don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . and our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get popularity for our product . but what's the function ? wel you could load up the batteries , you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there . for loading up the batteries . but it won't use much energy believe . it's just small display so believe it will run on one battery for six months or or or more . so believe one battery is just enough . elderly people just like to have everything in place . and don't think they they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . so docking station will help them give the remote place . and also what you said . you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote . but it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . so you have but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . and then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but then for only the the channels . i'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? that's good point . don't have any information on pricing . so i'll have to ask the manufacturing department . 'cause in our earlier market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , smartboard . so it was open here . we also asked if they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in remote control . you can see here , our target group would not do that . so if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control would greatly advise not to do it . that would be better to insert in our other product , that is meant for the younger people . but that would also go for the screen then . it's bit higher percentage , but . this is but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . so that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . and on top of that the screen would help in making the remote control easier to use . and voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . easier to use ? no , that's good point . but is our research about bi large sh display , or just small one we want to use ? this was for like an screen like you would have on on the the most advanced mobile phones . so pretty large . personally think the screen we wanna use , with the extra information , nobody has anything against it . because it's just some extra information , and it's easy to ignore as . so if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it . and the we have to discard the voice recognition . because it will increase cost signifi significantly . and don't think the don't will be lot easier to use , as . so that brings us back to the energy . if we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use lot of energy to use . so in that case we could use kinetic energy , but just simple battery which you can reload on docking station is just as good . and much cheaper as . so let me just choose for the battery . and that's the best choice . that brings us to the chip . there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . just the advanced . so it's gotta be advanced . and then we get to the point of the case . which brings us little bit back to marketing as . if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . as we saw there is not wood is lot more expensive to produce . but it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . look i've got new remote control , and . and most important factor there is the wooden colour . so it wouldn't actually have to be wood , if it's just wood-coloured . but with colour was lot more expensive ? i'll have to research . it's lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the shape . is it possible to make changeable case . so you 'cause with mobile phones so like the nokia mobile phones , when you can change the case of it . change the cases . so it's possible possibility . so you have just to make one standard remote control , and you can sell few . you can sell the cases . that's very good option . because then you can advertise as with the give your grandfather new case for his remote control , or whatever . because that's it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , which we can get advantage point . that is true . so and then you can make them with colour . black and grey , other colours as . we would have to look carefully into the design though . 'cause we would have to make one control which would fit in with wooden cover and plastic cover . the more original one , or the more standard one . so that would wouldn't design telephone but no we should just , we should then just design one one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . so you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , . so , but that shouldn't be too much of problem . so everybody's with the changing covers ? that's good good option . changing case covers . heard our industrial designer talk about flat , single and double curved . could you explain that little more ? the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . and our manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . and what would single curved and double curved mean ? it would just only affect the form , for as far as know . so it's really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . it doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . so we can just do whatever we want . pick one you like , yes . but the form has to be it has to it's has to be possible to stand up ? or just only to lie down ? no just to lie down . and the the cover of the the docking station is also on top of the television then ? we'll go for that . or besides it . and you can just then click it in . so the interface . what type of interface do we want to use ? you can make little drawing of it on the on the the board . does somebody have ideas for form or . we can just use the regular form of it , but it's not quite fancy . you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily that was very good point 'cause pointed out earlier that lot of remotes r_s_i_ . so that would be for that . we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the side . for left-handed users also . we is it possible to program it so you got on the left side or on the side buttons for for shifting up and shifting up ? and on the other other side buttons for shifting , for for the sound ? for the volume . or or isn't it ? that could we could do that but i'm not if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . usabili ease of use will be lot more difficult , and then it's but you have extra buttons . but if we would make changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield options for the design of the remote . 'cause it could be made all symmetrical and . so people can get confused . that is true . especially if they have the same writings on it . or we have to make left for lefties and you mean if no . can't we make can't we make remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one ? then you have to let's see if ca blank one . and then you get here's little screen . now have to think . it's plus and min . no it's not very handy . because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of no that's not gonna work . but is it problem that left-handed persons use different hand ? the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing channel or . that is true . it's just using your thumb . we could just leave it normal shape . but we have to make it bit more fancy . in one or ano another way . we should start by by choosing case . because that's the basis you're building on . so could draw them out . let's look at the flat case . it's from the side so it's rather normal . the the single curved so i'm not really what they're gonna look like , but it's something like this . so this type should be better for you or better should prevent repetitive strain injury bit . and the double curved looks something like this . so those are the three options we have . suggest the single curved , because the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . so that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's bit , it has bit of angle . so do you say this you got like believe there ? so you want to put display over here ? but now it's do you have it upside down or do you have it this that's top ? we can make it ? that's the top . so this top . it's possible to make this side like let's see . to make this side like the colour . bit like so in the form of your hand . so it's an so so the remote control have to lay in your hand . so it's possib for so and and to put the the buttons for changing the channel over here . so get your mouse . that's good one . but it's better to put the screen on top . rem but this place it's . so just flip it hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here . if you can have this one , you turn it like this . and then flip it upside down . because your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . it's more logical to have it on top as because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above . so so five minutes . you should just start on blank page . so then we get here's that's the curve . here the display , and then buttons . and then we can have little bit off here and here . just that's for left hand and hand users . and then the rest of the buttons over here . but the on-off button , still on the top . still here jus that's . and i'd prefer the corners to be round . think that would be better . should be more bit more friendly , . friendly on the eye . where's my mouse ? then we've got general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . so now for the next meeting we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . it's important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote . so check out the corporate website . the user interface design , it's the same story . and product evaluation . so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one . but you're going to get your instructions sended by the coach . so just will put these minutes on the in the folder . and then we're going to try to finish our project , and make good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , . which are let's see . i'm not if you're going to start away to work together or you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . and then you'll get message . so that's it . then we can save this one in the folders group . yes , it's here . smartboard , there it it . so if you wanna have look at it , it's over there in the projects folder . and then we'll start in thirty minutes again .
i'm little late . got stuck in the traffic . that's possible on this time of day . starts at three o'clock . let me see . our fourth and last meeting . there he is . this our last meeting . in this meeting we will discuss our final design . and we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . and then we're going to close the project today as . so after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . and this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . in order to do that we have this agenda . we'll have the prototype presentation first . then we will set up some evaluation cri criteria . then we will look at the finance . we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and half euro per remote . but we will see that later . then we will do the project evaluation , and the closing after that . we've got forty minutes . so we will be finished at half past three . but first we will do the this is prototype presentation . so , if some if somebody wants step forward . this is what me and richard came up with . the default spot for the on-off button . the mute button just below that . then there's the volume and channel selectors . simple plus-minus button . we thought of help button . if you hold it and you press another button , the help goes to the screen . then there's the zero to one to zero buttons . button for teletext . button for the subtitles . and the company logo . so it's rather simple prototype . and we'll have to see from testing how the users take it . is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? just pop in at any time . when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you go to the next teletext page . that's just the normal as as the normal remote controls so you put it you came in page one hundred . now you can use the normal one to zero buttons . and you but you can also use the button for changing the the channel . so the shifting button . for shif shifting up in on on teletext , and shifting down . but in few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple . just few buttons and large buttons . but these are altogether quite quite few buttons . so i'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons . if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this . and the on-off button , it's it's necessity . you can't drop that one . the volume and channel buttons , you need you need those those . the mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume-down button twice . so we could cancel that one . the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to button does . or you can build in when you press one button . if you put . we disc discuss that already . but we think old people that option . so they just put in put press the button and and . you can't leave out the number buttons . teletext and subtitles are necessary . so it's rather basic already . that's what pointed out earlier . if you just make control for just the t_v_ there's just not much to gain here . so we had somebody about interfa something about the design of the buttons there ? they're it's rather hard to draw on the white-board . just normal plain buttons . but they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with with little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and . just to recognise it , so and now we don't need leds or some remote controls do it also , but because we use the little display we don't have to use it . just for recognition . so and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . with different colour than the case . so they jump out . and that's about it . then because we only have thirty minutes left , will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . and tell you that we're going to have pretty hard time producing this for twelve and half euros . if we see if i've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see something wrong . counted two batteries . but we can also use one . if it's possible . since it rechargeable . we can just . that's two euros off . we need the advanced chip . so there's not much to to save there . here we have the single curves . we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one euro . , but the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have prominent place on the remote control . we have to keep that . then we have the case material supplements . it's the cheapest one we need . so that's not much to save either . but then the biggest costs are the buttons . so we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low . because you have to we will have to get the twelve and half euros at the end . so if we let's fir first count the buttons we have now . sixteen , believe so . nah , that will be even more then . so , seventeen . with the help button . including the help ? we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long , or pressing down number long . that saves us one euro already . 'cause then we have got fifteen ? that wouldn't be an option . and this is no those are one , . assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , ? think actually there're two buttons , aren't they ? where did , it's just one button . there were two for one big button . but they are more expensive than the small ones . but it's not stated in this files . so it's just . so we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing that's possibility as . was thinking , you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . that would cut the cost . so and it's good for the design as . so you can make let's see . if you make this looks bit like cross . but don't if if it's cheaper . so , we've still got four buttons , but just so you got not not butt button itself , but on the . they count the materials . on the chip there . on the chip you've got still four four buttons . so , but . but because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button . but no but . but , this really is four buttons anyhow . it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and half euros . also the l_c_ display , it's , it's too expensive for the display we use . that's that's big cost . they try , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . only the docking station , . which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this schematic . so it's not even taken into the price . we should to different supplier . that's an option . don't you think we can , if we can count this as as one button , and integrate these buttons in three , then we save lot of money as . we we could save money on it . but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ? that's what i'm wondering . my mother can't even send send an s_m_s_ message . since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up little . are we gonna buy remote control when you can use it ? we we must stay below the below twelve fifty or can't go nay . especially since we have those features . but we have to stick to the twelve and half euros . we don't have any more budget to develop it . the margin will get too small . is it impossible to but it is possible to make one for twelve fifty . so it is . if you leave out the l_c_ display . it would be be pretty rigid one . and if you use less buttons . say or you can take the single chip . but , you can't use . there it is . but we want to make so fancy and good . but then good looking . wi with , with attractive options . so , you can stay below twelve fifty . so scroll-wheel's one . it's difficult as , but or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . or becoming choice between like either good remote and higher production cost , or just any other remote control . then because then we save ten buttons . that's we're getting closer . no , it . then we have five and one . and and see . if we have this one and we've got the advanced , we're getting close . but how does scroll-wheel work here ? then you will or you can scroll . if you scroll you will see the numbers on the display . until you've got the number , then you push it . that would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . integrated scroll-wheel push-button . it's gotta scroll and push . but then you you can push some other button as . you could just not scroll for half second . so you won't need button . so if you scroll to number and then you half second , then it turns to that channel . that would be like the end of our usability . but it would definitely crop cost , lot . but , t's the teletext subtitles are now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , and teletext disappears . and we need the battery . and the regular chip is not possible ? it has to be advanced ? if you want to use an screen you you need an advanced chip , yes . it has to be advanced . and we can save euro by flat design . that's an option we can then we're almost there . if you could just leave out one more button . so if we but that's that is big advantage , if we're but can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? or we have to skip the subtitle button . so it's big advantage . but , it's , . if you push it three times ? but the subtitles stay there . but if you push the teletext button twice it's one one , few buttons . that's the case on most , that could be just like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? eight hundred eighty eight . that's not really that no . but then again that would be just not an option for older people , who don't even scroll-wheel is . holding remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . with only five buttons on it . if you make good advertisement on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . if you just make it real simple . because it saves it saves lot of money . and we can keep our screen , which can provide extra information . how to use the scroll wheel . how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . and it's good for the innovative design as . if you would erase these . and we put looks bit odd . that's pretty big scroll wheel . that is something like that . we've got the scroll-wheel . one , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . and these are two buttons then . we could make two buttons out of that . and just if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . so that would save two buttons . if you do the same for the channel . that's really good good idea , . and it will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious . so we make one for the volume , one for the channel . so if we . so we've got one , two , three . we can leave the teletext in if we want . that's that's better . so if we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . so this is five buttons . and make it smaller overall . so if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen behi under that , than the scroll button you get much smaller remote . and then you can . and it sh ? so we can decrease this one to four buttons . now we have five . but , you can make quite big remote remote control for just the same price as small one . just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . that's no problem . it it's bit . it's it's more the moulds in which they are being made , . single curved is really easy to just fill in . and cases come out of the machine . and single curved you have to have different different machine , than flat one . this is really easy one . what does everybody think about flat or single curved design ? freek , what do you think ? still think we should go for the single curve design . but then again , all these changes are not really with me . richard's argument was very good . but since we just have to . we have to cut costs . i'm ag ask for more money . i'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars remote . am agreeing with the usability . or do some market research and see what the options are . but we can then keep the single curved one . just to express our screen bit more . so people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . it will be necessary to have good help function , as . so this is scroll . it was better to have this price list bit earlier . before we went on to the to the whole design . but i'm glad we could make bit . it's pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one . it's pretty different . but this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . this will really require lot of marketing to get this to sell . 'cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar . but but they know the scroll-buttons from old radios . this is not familiar for them . no , but the most . so we're gonna have to do lotta convincing them . they cal also buttons like that for changing channels . we can let we can stick it out , bit . like old old buttons . that's recognisable for them as . that's good one . so , i'm afraid we have to move on . and it's it's less frightening , . if they see this design they think , there are only five buttons , and but we will see . might might be confusing too . they'd be like , what ? only five buttons ? but very special , so no . would buy it . but you're not sixty . would buy it if was six . what it costs under twelve and half euros ? yes they are . but we can go on with the project evaluation . we still have fifteen minutes left , so we're on schedule . the project process . so , like set up all these criteria . and evaluation of the thingy . that was the the point forgot . should there we are . we've got five minutes for those criteria . five more minutes ? no we've got fifteen minutes but yes . so did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . translated it into criteria , which would be these . is the remote fancy ? the shape , look and feel . what new functions are there ? easy to use ? learnability is very important factor here . is it functional ? are there not too many functions among the functions ? and are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? and the cost . the target group . is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? if our company is if it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? and so we're supposed to evaluate it now . have to say this was little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . that's because my pen failed to upload his data . tried to but it's it's giving errors by downloading the software . so is the design fancy , on scale of one to seven ? we all go for six ? is the design innovative ? so , with our screen , docking station , scroll-buttons . subtitles , buttons . so we've got twenty cents for our docking station , ? should be do-able . is the design easy to use ? that's bit dodgy . would be for us . but i'd go for four , too . for old people . would say four . four or five . four or five between . between four or five . is it functional ? is the design functional ? do we have all functions that we want to include ? do we have too many functions ? it's pretty slim . and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? like it getting lost and r_s_i_ influences ? we haven't thought of that one . think we do . had them worked out . they are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost . are the production costs within the preset limits ? they are now . does the design fit the group of focus ? no with our new radio button , it's it's better . we have to test it but , , true . still it's too too fancy . radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have remote control . too too flashy . would give it four . i'd go for two . go for three . then we have to do the three . it's the yes it is . is the company company recognisable ? we have the logo there . and they wanna put fashion in their products . in the slogan of the company . and we have the removable front cases . so , it's very recognisable . so that will be this . was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this . we've got calculate it . twendag sieven an twendag . is this like after this , are we done ? or we're gonna go to our other room again . we've gonna we're going to evaluate it . these are seven factors times seven is forty something . minus three , minus four . so that would be minus eight . forty one out of forty nine . that's around eighty percent . what is it ? i'll just type that in on the bottom here . that's eighty four percent . that's pretty score . so that will be the evaluation . so , that brings us to the project evaluation . did we move through the phases , you think ? along the process ? think we should have should have had the finance thingy lot earlier . in the design phase . so lack of information about prices . was there room for creativity ? not too much . it's because of the finance sheet . there there was enough room , but the finance yes . but and would've liked to go for the younger users also . the room was . and just to be able to access internet and get something of your own . was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions ? did it work out ? also , you two of you with the last phase ? yes , was . the tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy . were the means sufficient for the tasks we had to do ? or were they too much ? the smart-board , the drawing is just pain in the ass , but the digital the digital pen is very . if it wants to download its data . smart-board was irritating . so you rather wanted to have flip-over ? flip-over or more precise digit yes . flipper's easier , so . faster as , . but if you want to share of when you make picture like this on the presentation , it's easier to share it with other people . so you can sh save it and put it on the internet , or in shared folder or sh shared directory . tried to open the file on my laptop , but not possible . you need smart board application . can can you export it like . but you can . should be possible . you can export it as image . must must be so the sharing of the information was was ? should've done that then . pen is here . pen is here on the table . so you can it's possible . have we found new ideas for having this meetings ? when we just give the numbers of of one of out of sev it's easier to to do the things that are like that on computer . so just like at university so . so everybody puts his own score . and then it mediates the score , and you can get one . so that's how do we call ? any more ideas ? or questions about the project ? or about the product ? because then that we get to our last sheet . are the costs within the budget ? considering we are not going to make docking station . do we docking station . that's good point . but because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be little bit higher ? and you can compensate that as . so that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as . do we think we gonna get the twelve and half million ? or what was it ? fifteen fifteen million . if we gonna export this product . especially in america . people are pretty decadent . still if we're gonna make scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . you can do more . so we should just re-focus . just put it on the market for everybody . you can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . or specifically for younger people . that's one thing you can change it with . so you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on on the market . just as test . see how it works . that's good advantage . then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . even if it were their covers . then we can have our little celebration , now . but party party . we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . where's the champagne ? didn't get message from the from ending of the have one now . five more minutes ? then we still have some questions . if somebody has some questions they can ask them now . or we can put these in the project folder as . that's export as picture , . this is another network , . does somebody see the project folder ? they will save it . i'll just put it in my documents and that's . it probably will . i'm going to make our final presentation now . you're supposed to make final are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? and then will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . summary of the project . we have to fill another questionnaire . you all get questionnaire in in your room . and then i'll meet you in about ten minutes , . hopefully my pen will download its software .
before start with the with the meeting have few things to tell you about the the setting we're in , because we're being watched by big brother . by big brother ? this these are cameras , so are these . this thing that looks like pie , are actually all microphones . so you must be careful with with all this . and as see you you have placed your laptops exactly on the place where it must be . and that has to do with the camera settings , so we don't have our laptops in front of the cameras . of our faces . so they can see our faces . welcome at the kick-off meeting . my name is danny wolfs . this is the agenda for today . first little opening . will introduce myself , and it's very good to introduce yourself . then little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to to to ourselves . so we get to know each other . that will be done with tool training from the he these two smart boards . then the project plan . what we're going to do , and how we're going to do it . and discussion about that and little closing at the end . my name is danny wolfs . i'm the project manager . what's your name ? i'm juergen toffs . i'm the user interface designer . user interface , . hi , my name's . i'm the industrial designer . industrial , yes . my function is the marketing expert . first little about the project aim . the the the aim is to make new remote control . you have read read the website . it's very , , very ambitious company . they they wanna do something else . there must be new remote control . first of all it must be original , and trendy . that's two things really close to each other . but at the same time user-friendly . and they have , that's very important for them . there are three stages . there is functional design . so what are we going to to do ? what are we going to make functions in the remote ? and why are we going to do it ? then the conceptual design . how are going to do it ? and that's really global . because at the detailed design , how , part two , we go to dig in really about how the the te the technical of if it's it's possible technical-wise . each stage is is broken up in two two stages , individual work and meeting . so it's it's very straightforward . the tool training . we have two smart boards . this one is for the presentations , the powerpoint presentations or the word presentation of whatever you you had . and this is only for drawing . so we must let it stand on this this programme . this is called smart board thing , it speaks for itself . speaks for itself . and as you may have heard , the documents in the shared folder can be showed on this screen . not in the the my documents . so if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . this is very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . don't gonna explain it all , because how it works . we must not forget everything we draw on here , all must be saved . we we may not delete anything . so if you have drawn something , save it . never delete it . that's very important thing . little little kinda exercise to know each other . at the white board on the left . every every one of us must draw our favourite animal , and tell tell us why we had chosen that animal . important is that we use different colours , and different pen widths . this exercise , did the company board tell you to do it , or did you just make it up yourself ? no no no . it's it's must do it . it's part of the introduction , . 'cause we really each other , and it's kinda new . so getting used to each other , we can have little fun then , before we dig in really to the hard . would you start with drawing your favourite animal ? really how it works . but you can show us first ? drawing goes with this thing . do not touch your hand on this little thingy here . so hold it like this . you you get electrocuted or it's like pictionary ? so , you must push little good . because and few seconds . it's not fully real-time , so watch it . 'm gonna paint in the red . that's the background colour . that's the one . my favourite animal ? you can what it is . the the one who says it first gets raise . may paint next . no , it's not an orc . you don't see it at the ears ? have it at home . you have an orc at home ? so it's cat . what's it called ? 'cause we have cat at home and he's called simba . 'cause he looks like the the the lion from the lion king . so we found it kinda to name it after lion . he's happy with us , so he's smiling . he does have body . no , only the face . because we have we have twen twenty five minutes . we have to speed up . remember you use different colours , and different pen widths . who wants to go next ? so choose colour , choose pen width and draw . you don't have to change the colour and the pen width during the drawing . or you have to draw push hard on the pen or . you have to save it . save it , . i've done it . which one is it ? i've speed up . by the way , why was your cat red ? because my cat is red at home . and have red hair , so must be red . it's very bloody cat . no , it's turtle . it's an apple . it's not an apple . must be dog . something like this . it is turtle . it is turtle . 'cause liked teenage mutant hero turtles . you watched it lot ? you watched it lot ? it's inside its shell . you'll be finished sooner . no , it's no no . it's scared turtle . it's coming up . something like this . jurgen , you want to go next ? here you go . how did it work ? and then you have the the current colour , you can change . so no red or green . and line width . tim had tim , what kinda line width did you have ? the big lines were like nine . thought i'd pick the easiest one . you have dog at home ? we had dog , few years ago . it's it's pretty good an artist . and and it , , when it died we didn't get new one . but graphical user designer , so . you have an artistic inner middle . think you picked the wrong function . can work together . so you can see it's real really easy programme to use . wha that's enough , . the last one ? after cat , turtle and dog . he's gonna draw an elephant . figure should do something like that , but i'm gonna do something much more difficult . he is the artistic design . i'm gonna design remote remote control animal . remote control animal . with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there . that that might be easier . but at the other hand , pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and it's easier to draw . better to draw with with but what is he ? with pen than with mouse mouse . than on the , with , like like on here , drawing drawing . and then displaying on screen , but too expensive , . with this paper it's too mu too expensive . is it rabbit ? do you have rabbit at home ? it's rabbit with broken legs ? is it white rabbit it's the white rabbit from the matrix . there , the white green rabbit . he's little bit stoned there . figured this is pretty good impression of rabbit . it will do . finishing touch and then we're going further . have you been counting the time ? where does the pen go ? just figured the rabbit was actually the most impressive . let's go on then . the dog is the the most artistic . don't choose for youself . now we're gonna dig into the to the serious . it's pretty abstract . the selling price for the remote will be twenty five euro , and the production cost may not be more than twenty and half euro . so from my point of view , don't t's gonna be very very high tech , high definition , ultra modern kinda remote , for twelve fift twelve and half euro . the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million euro . so that's lot . we have to sell lot of when the selling price is twenty five , you got two million , two million remotes . how much is it ? like how much ? hundred million remotes ? two million , , two million . but our marketing range is , market range is international . so we have virtually the whole world we can sell we can sell our remotes to . at least that countries which have television . so now it's time for us to going to discuss little things . you can think about experience with remote control yourself , at home . what you think might be useful new feature . what what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . so let's let's discuss little . i'm gonna join you at the table . what what's the most important thing at remote control ? the most important thing of remote control is that you can switch channels . and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . is it possible to open pen drawings in this on this screen ? so not not remote control who which can can be used for television and d_v_d_ and radio and or just only if you have them on . but have some points . can show them on the on the big screen ? in case you want it this is dead fly . between the the the , , the the , be the screens . no no no . only all the drawings go there , at the left , that pen drawings . but which the ones we made on the , only in word , . no , when it is in word and you have saved it in the shared documents folder , you can show it there . have some points from marketing point of view . just the standard thing li things like intuitive , small , fairly cheap . it's pretty cheap , twenty five euros . it doesn't have to matter which brand your t_v_ or other thing is . i'll wrap it up quickly . personally has to be multi-purpose . most of the remote remote controls are just for one purpose . and by making it multi-purpose , it has new feature , adds new feature to the market , and distinguish from from current products . some other technology than infrared . rather find it very annoying , like when someone is standing in front of the t_v_ then you can't switch it . think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . that might be little bit expensive . and something like an screen . for what purpose ? like said here it's easy . it's as an added feature feature , that , when you're on certain channel , you can see on the screen what programmes are coming up or from my point of view , . so it be multi-purpose very technically high remote ? it must be really innovative , technical-wise ? it has to be , our company is very good in making new innovative things . so , agree with you . so to the current market . we and and the price . so we must focus on things who are really really add something to to . look , you got some cheap remote controls there . they just , you got dozen of . but when you enter new market with remote control and wanna gain market share you have to do something special , . but we have to keep an eye that it's at the beginning of such project , it's it's it's very to talk about , , this would be , that would be . but we must not lose sight of the the user friendly . but it's but but this is just from marketing aspect . anything about user interface or design . and that's because we have him . and and him . next meeting will start in thirty minutes . so you will have individual actions where presume will be some feedback , via the the mail . the the the industrial designer has to look at the working design . the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions . so that's the thing we discussed . one thing , we must first agree on what we're going to going to make . do we are we going to use it it for multiple systems ? or we should have some agreement on that before we . don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . that's phase further . ju just make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . and and then we can plan . we can plan further , . but , because you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we must have little or kinda how do you call it ? consensus on the , what we're gonna do . little plan on on what we're going to do . so you don't come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions . some basic things we co we want to going to do . will come in handy . you're the project manager . if the technical functions have to be designed , i've gotta know for what machines they will be . or do we use it text screen ? or will it be with with bluetooth or . that's that's really step further . but if you say is it one way or multi-purpose , that's why ? tha that's same step further . actually it is . then looking at individual components , so that's actually step further . like we all have list of things that has to that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . and then in the next meeting we decide what it's gonna be . we can take it from there . agree , we can take it from there . and then you then you can delete the the obsolete details . so each individually individually must think on what's at his point of view is the most important . and then we're going to fit all the pieces together the next meeting . must finish off now , so it's over . you will receive specific specific instructions by your personal coach . and see you in thirty minutes .
see my bunny is still standing . no one drawing it . it's too beautiful . figured that much . minute , my laptop is , there it is , . so welcome back . at the functional design meeting the plan is that each one of you , so not me but only you will present the the things you worked on the last half hour . will take minutes and will put the minutes that have at the end of the session in the shared folder . also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that now or afterwards . had an email from the from the management board , if you al also received it , but there were four points which are very important . first one is they think that teletext teletext becomes outdated and internet will be the the main focus . second one is also important , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it not gonna it's not gonna be multi-purpose remote control , so that's one thing to keep in mind . second , and that's important for the marketing expert , the current customers are in the age group group of forty years and older , but with this new remote they will would like to reach group younger than forty . and to keep in mind , but not really for now is that they want the the the slogan and the and the logo to to be recognised more in the remote . so , we have forty minutes , so not more than ten minutes per presentation each , and use all the the the facilities so that you have either smartboards , the the word files , what you whatever you want . so tim , can you start ? have some new findings on marketing expert level , which will show you . the method used was giving orders to our usability lab to do questionnaire . one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated report with lot of results . these were couple of findings , first page of three . we have three audiences of two audiences , i'm . the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five . as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five . second audience audience is thirty five percent . and some interests from the from the age groups , it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology , like an screen on the remote control , speech recognition . don't think that's really appropriate . and when you see the audience , the age is going up , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls . first point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when remote control would look fancy . so that's something for the user interface designer . according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , following buttons are most important . will tell something about the way this this test was , , done . persons were asked what the buttons were they use most , how much an hour , and in the second table the importance of those buttons . when you multiply them , you get the these three points . switching channels , , that's pretty pretty normal , that's what you do with remote control . the second , teletext , and the third , volume controls . it's good that we the user want wants , at least the these three points have to be very clear . but it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet . so that that's strange . , but at the moment teletext is , the best thing you can get on t_v_ , like getting information . so , when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on remote control . that's ne it it's new technology , but it's not incorporated now . my personal preferences . we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five . first of all it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . second , you will get the most revenue from from it . , people from sixteen to forty five watch lot of t_v_ , more than people who are el elder . second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . third point that came out of the of the questionnaire , people used to get lost off the remote controller , so it's an idea for us to design ex placeholder on side of the , , of the t_v_ where you can put the the remote control in . that's about it , . when you mentioned improving functions , what what do you mean by that what what are you think about ? not not the not the functions , but it came out that lot of buttons weren't even used on remote control . so you can have remote control full of buttons , hundreds hundreds of buttons , but if you don't use them , it's , they have to be on it just to to get it done if necessary , but the most used buttons have to be bigger or , perhaps . so focusing more on the used buttons . could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function . just for the minor functions perhaps . ma perhaps , just just an idea . just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn . i'll go , . janus , can you , janus . i'll be explaining bit about working design about the project . what did was dissected current remote controls and viewed how how they looked , how they worked , what components are involved , and how they are connected together . and after that put up scheme about how these things are organised and i'll show it to you in in in few seconds . and i'll explain bit about how it works and how we could build one and why several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . what did was checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . and the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as t_v_ or stereo , and those have transmitter that's also focused on infrared , so if we want to build remote control with bluetooth then the t_v_ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus that's that wouldn't mean cheap remote control for us . so that's probably why most controls are still infrared . furthermore they all have very simple structure , so that would probably mean lower costs and that could mean for us good thing 'cause we should be able to build relatively cheap cheap remote . as mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth may be possible , but figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget , but that's not for me to decide , but that's something for marketing to look into . because my personal opinion is is not to do bluetooth or or radio waves , although , actually have . what do you think about incorporating bluetooth or radio receiver in the place-holder next to the t_v_ , connected to the t_v_ ? so it's in the wrong product . actually figured that would be that would be rather , but then you'd still have the the infrared function . so in in theory you'd actually just move the problem , but what did think about was when you mentioned about the the cup-holder , is why not introduce speech function like where is the remote . if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep beep beep beep , , something to look into , what the cost that something like that would be . but it may be may be something to explore . i'll i'll just explain bit of the components . first you have the energy source . the energy source would be battery , simple battery that you can find anywhere . figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery stops functioning we could just use you could just go out and buy new one . so we didn't and we don't have to do all to be too complicated about that . the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch there is switch between these . when the switch is pressed in on this this case it switches button , when button is prush pushed in , electric current goes through here , and in immediately , bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened . that's that's so the user won't be thinking , did the button be pressed , what happened . or press button but nothing's happening on the t_v_ , so is is something wrong . so that's just to to to explain the of to to make it clearer to the user . the signal goes via chip that's translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be received on the receiving end . and those interpreted by the device , this case the television . my personal preferences here , have to keep it simple . not too many gadgets and functions , just like you said the most users you have lot of buttons and you use you don't use them , so why why should we invent spend more time on those . we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving . so no input from the television . so we shouldn't be spending time on teletext and st things like that , because when you want teletext on infrared you'd have to build in receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from what's on t_v_ and such . so figure that would be spending too much money and time and yes , but what should we agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building receiver into the remote control ? , another problem , current t_v_s can even send infrared . 'cause that would be extra components , extra designs , larger remote control . these all all that we have to take in account . so my personal opinion is no no no receiver . should look into the design and the functionability . like said , use one button for multiple functions , or just hide the few buttons of switching it open , the usual . and don't overbuild , we shouldn't make big remote control for simple functions , but we we should stick to the basics . so that was my my personal opinion . and that was my my presentation , but . yes , go ahead . the last presentation . you have plenty of time , tim and janus don't talk to ten minutes , so take your time . if you take your time too long will eventually warn you . i'm going to give presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions . what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you going to design remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the if it's possible to make , , but also the user friendliness , so tha that's that's some of the main points . and another one is the use of many functions will will make it more difficult , so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . if you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons to be shown at the same time , 'cause when you visit an internet site you don't want fifty links to see , but use hierarch hierarchy structure . and one of the ideas was use touch screen , but in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything , but we might consider that . hope this is all clear to you . if you you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions , but , your thumb is little bigger than it than this . you have to be very careful what you push , and if you're looking for teletext you'll be searching for half an hour from , where is it ? where the hell he here and , , when you have to use something else . so just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . if you want to use play and back and stop , that's very important . this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but it's no longer applying . prefer to use it only for t_v_ and not to give too many options and and if possible , the buttons should give dr direct action , not first select , and so that's where the difficulties lie . you you just said you wanted to to combine more functions in one , so you you want to keep it simple , but that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons which give more options than one . this so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other . but , but you you have to keep in mind that several t_v_s don't even have menu structure , or they have very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all not our remote won't be able to work on all televisions . do we want to use few options and might not be so or original , or multi-purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons . so weighing those factors . it's an option if you use an or touch screen , that in the middle are the the main keys , like displayed on the . something like that . just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching , and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or that you can drop down . but when all the questions had do we want to use menu display on the t_v_ ? or does have to everything be in remotes ? 'cause if you use memory display on the t_v_ , you can simply push more menu and then select the options you want to have and press . so that's my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the t_v_ and don't use combination of of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users . so too , but and that's partly because lot of t_v_s have different menus , and when you have particular menu at your device , it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on t_v_ . that will be problem . and that would be considerable problem . so if we have to stick with current technologies and , the restrictions of what's is on the market today , you should keep it at this . use big clear buttons . not too many . so we'll loose few option options , but this is more important . especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it somewhere away on the remote , behind little little thing or touch screen . not embed , but then with something like touch screen could could make more menu up pop up . and , if you want to put on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . not first change menu options or switch something . , as you already told , give some feedback . if the user is pushing button he should the television or at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . and , , my conclusion is is less is more , keep it simple . so we should just ease down on the functionality to to keep it accessible on because you all know , if there are lot of function on the the television , some you you'll never know and never use , and therefore it's important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not so important you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions . the idea about touch screen is very good . because recently saw news item on t_v_ about new telephones for elder people . they have like touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang-up , and that's big ad advantage , because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures . it's very visual intended . what was to say more ? that's an option . keep the primary buttons visible . make remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues , put logo on it and use it in some aesthetic aesthetic form . but the important buttons make them always accessible and pushable and clear and use touch screen , or if that's will become too difficult just like televi some older telephones use it's possible to to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible . but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ? the extra functions . the extra functions , you you just see menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , and then all all the options will become available and you just scroll through them . but like menu functions or . wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , one one small touch screen applet and i'll just make let's say fifteen buttons on it , and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub-menus , with or sub-items , sub-functions . then i'd like to make proposal . if you make one big touch screen , use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . , like like the ipod idea that that we just saw . you just have few selected buttons and few menus , and with this idea you could actually make several you can also improve later on . that will be . so you t's will be better to have kinda total touch screen . wou would actually go for the . agree , but it's very important that they always make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options part of the touch screen . and so an elder designer picks up the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the t_v_ or to switch the channel without using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . had another idea about parental control . like building in some pin code which allows parents to switch to all channels , but children if children don't the pin code , they can't switch to violent channels or there's just ju just simple log-in , something like that . wh is that possible to use or no ? that is possible , that that actually depends on the television , but figure that would be , you you see the fi thing is when you buy remote , you you set the channels , the the channels are different on each te television , they aren't set in preset order , so if you lock on remote , let's say channel fifteen , channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be that would be actually the main concern . , does it have to depend on the television ? that he means that by some option make that remote control and the t_v_ match , and then after that you can use some insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this change the settings of the t_v_ , like colour and then volume and . that , but if you log in first as parent , you address the the channels and like , that's channel fifteen , that's vi violent channel , my ki my kids don't want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents , . something like that . but make it separate option in the menu , so that it's it's dif dis displayed from displayed here , so parents , you can de display it on the on the old style . that would , that . but , but but , that's just that's an an added feature . but let's not go too wide about the those things , that's that why we're here . those things are . it's it's idea , but that's we wel later in the stage . i've one little question about total touch screen or , partial , because elderly people may be not used to touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be , , kinda traditionals and the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions to be on the touch screen , but to keep this as normal as possible , to keep it accessible . but but if you display it on screen with really big numbers that's just as just as easy . do do agree , because , it's just not the same when you touch touch screen or when you touch button , but have to look at what's our target audience . you can display actual buttons on the touch screens . that's true , that's true . we are aiming for younger people and they they chose so that's that's probably but they they they all have to be programmed to fit your t_v_ and that that is bit of tricky job . that's true , . age below forty . , , that's good point . and those young people , . you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy , so touch screen , like microsoft al already developed something like that for multi-media applications . they like the fancy , . we can do that too . as you can see the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are are done . i've added the this four things from the management board just to keep in mind . each time had summary on what you told and what you personal think . so that can be can be read out . few things noticed were moment . the the main points in this in this meeting is how it's going to look with we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden , so they don't you don't have big thing full of buttons or and the point that you wanna use one controller for hypothetically each television , so you must the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television . that's the point what we discussed . , some of them . the menus are not identical for all for all t_v_s , so you have to display it on one t_v_ . you can use when you how do you call it , synchronized , the remote and the t_v_ , then there's always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and we can look out if there's options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda t_v_ it is , from , it's philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the there are universal remotes and they all have functionality for all the t_v_s , so this wouldn't be extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these . but that's not possible . but you have an , but you have an international market range , so you have big range of . add that that's an opportunity . and it's not too complex to do it . actually use one of those when they are they are kinda kinda troublesome , but but the thing is whe when you start building something like this you have to build receiver into the into the remotes , because in order for the remote to process something from the t_v_ , like to synchronise and you have to send and receive , and that's . mo no , you can just say the . no no no . just build it in . he he he he me he means just just one other thing . with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press , you have to press code for t_v_ . in codes , you you get book with codes . you look up , have philips h_ fifty five and it says press code four five five and you press code four five five on the in the remote and it displays all your menu options . , , that would be possible , . now we just connect the t_v_ type to set of options , in just just in the memory , so that if you , like profile , so that if you touch in like one four one zero t_v_ the memory pops up the options . memory in the in the remote . that would be possible . don't think that's that takes lot of storage space or some just varia variables . no , that wouldn't be , few variables . if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are three four hundreds t_v_s at maximum . if you have all of them , all the old and new t_v_s summed up , so it is possible . it is definitely po , firmware upgrade . but , on the other hand on the other hand , if you have remote and buy new t_v_ that isn't incorporated in the remote new remote ? we have five minutes to go . then you have to buy new one , it's very good for marketing , or an update , software update . firmware upgrade , but from where ? firmware update , you say . no may no , we can incorporate some u_s_b_ or firewire connection , so that you can connect it to the p_c_ and download the newest firmware from from the internet . that's the cup holder . not everybody has has p_c_ at home . the most most people have , but not not everybody and . at you can go back to the shop and they , ser and they can download it for you . like service centre . something like service cen or you could you could actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably make connection to an telephone line or internet connection . already digital information is sent to the the standards , t_v_ connections , you can see what's programme is on on the new channels , so they we can send that information along with standard t_v_ receiving . then then it's be back to the building receiving if it's actually worth it to build it in , we could actually look at into it , but , it it would be bringing more costs with with it and , that would be probably best , . it's most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service centre or at the shop . some it's good idea , . like when you when you buy t_v_ you just ask 'll . it's it's it's not lot of work , just one docking station where you put it in , press start , bling bling , updated . that would be best , . you don't buy t_v_ every week , new teev so . let's save this in the meanwhile for which one are we going ? exactly , so , my vote goes out to the . that one or your vote and your . my vote too . and your vote ? was doubting about which one to take , but you've convinced me that if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on normal remote all elderly people will to do . and also like clapping li like device that pops open . opens up is too difficult or break it , don't get so . too difficult , it's easier to break it . it's very sensitive . like my telephone , it's it's sensitive too . it's almost at the end . so we have now lunch break , finally , . after the lunch break it's back to individual work , once again thirty minutes . will put my minutes have updated them so they're updated in the shared folder too . thirty minutes , the failure . the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the the the email . don't think say much about it , so for your email and hopefully you get it done in the in the thirty minutes , and will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes . one question , how late do we have to get back be back here ? quarter to one ? thirty minutes lunch break ? thirty minutes lunch break , . then would it be one o'clock . or we we ask our personal coach . that was very good session , we we ye , because all things are stored in smart board dot x_d_k_ and that's in no . is it possible to store this on the share documents or what , save it as an image on the res no , and use an image if possible . but but you can open from your pr from your laptop . not export function . can you all have the the questionnaire again about the after work . paper size four . in this directory . it's not connected to the to our p_c_s . it is connected . i'll just saved in my documents . in my own in my own messenger . project documents , . it gives the na . the questionnaire , fill in we fill out after lunch or . it's it's simply filling no , it's it's also filling out no , i'd do it after lunch . i'm hungry , so do it after lunch . aye , cheers . we can leave the p_c_ on , and return to the , bring to gotta bring it home . bring it to my personal room . to my exave executive aye . my executive big room with the with the panting .
project manager , have something to tell you . have little problems with my laptop . and so had little less time to complete . no , little problem , big problem . thought , it didn't work anymore . what was it , problem ? the entire windows it it hung . it hang hung . you're our project manager . your project manager . welcome to the conceptual design meeting for real reaction . it's the same as the last time . also this time there will be three presentations . and we must reach decision on the remote control concepts . and at the end , , when finish it off have some input from master class visited . during lunch , . he's the master , . master of i'm . the the the the the concepts on we where we must reach decision on . our from are of two sorts . components concepts and user interface concepts . the first one is really about the the the the the total package with , we have decided to do do the with touch-screen that must be case around it so it won't be as breakable . how how about the energy ? can you can you reload it or just have batteries which you must exchange ? the user interface concept . with the type and the the supplements . so where to put what button . and would say jans , can you begin ? at the end , will take notes and at the end of the minutes will be at the shared folder . let me see . it's this one . , i'll be talking about the components . what did was reviewed previously used items by two two different age groups . below forty five and above . and watch what the differences are and checked , , what what do we want , and how can we aim at the target group . what found was that senior senior citizens ye , it's it's . they , , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more . wood and chrome . and they like straightforward shapes . they they they they like luxurious styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like more soft materials . think of the teletubbies , . soft and fluffy and colourful and , shapes are curved and round . you get the picture . and they like sports and gaming , and that gives them the vitality . so , firs yes . one one little question . about the the material . soft material for remote control ? no , i'll i'll get to that . you you'll see . first off , let's start start with the energy . had choice between few different sources . but the two basic sources that found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic . kinetic , that's when you move something , then it gets energy . figured , that's ki kinda high-tech , when when you have remote control that , when you pick it up , it has power . that would be actually very , figured . we could also use battery , that's bit . but when the power gets low , you have to shake it ? you just you have to shake it around little bit . and then then it then it has some more energy . you could just go for battery . or you can go for both ? have you considered the option of using solar panel ? but the thing is about solar panel is you have to have light . and you you could you could use normal light , but you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from battery . for ultimate use of solar panels , you could actually use you could use solar panels , but you ha you'd have to implement them into the remote control , leaving you bit less space for the interface . it's too less space . so so it it what's actually just in i've figured it out that , seeing that you'll always be within the distance of t_v_ , and the from t_v_ there comes whole bunch of light . so it would actually power itself from t_v_ . but , you just take up all the space , and you wouldn't have the full amount of power actually used . but you prefer kinetic ? so prefer kinetic because it's , the costs aren't that much higher , and , ju just bit more high-tech than than normal battery . if no , but , you pick it up and you press buttons and , you , actually it is . but you don't move remote control too much . and that's enough to to keep the energy level . and it it if it isn't , you just shake it bit and and add add with power up again . but , what what jarek said , you could you could use battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . and for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery . and when the battery doesn't work , usually shake it too . so like slamming on it . it's exactly the same . and so that , furthermore , you you we checked the cases . we have different options concerning the cases . you ha you sim you simply add basic standard model it was square and figured that's bit boring . so you you we could go for the single curved or the double curved . single curve , it's just , , , it's just curve . or but but you could go in in an double curves . and that's like several different dimensions . that gives you an whole new effec , that gives you younger and more high-tech look , figured . dynamic dynamic look ? but , that we'll discuss later . but , are you going to draw it ? you want me to draw in three-d_ ? , ca ca could could show you . 't imagine how how how it looks like . could show you . let's say you let's say that's your standard that's bit your standard design . but you could actually go like something like this . and then in three-d_ effect you could go so you you just , this is this bit difficulty in didn't take major in art . so but but you could have whole new the back back the the the depth , you could you could just play around bit with . you you don't have to use standard you could it leaves more space for creativity . that might be an idea , but just , furthermore , , plastic versus rubber ? you we could choose what what's better , plastic or rubber . ch prefer rubber because it feels . it's soft and it's that like soft . that's the material the younger people want , ain't it ? plastic is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic your your usually associate plastic with something that's cheap . that's just me , but , we could , , talk about it later . furthermore , buttons . traditional or touch screen . we discussed it in previous meeting , so figured i'll just leave it at the . and chip set , if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go with simple chip set . but if we decide to go on screen , we would use an we have to use an advanced chip set . and that would bring the necessary costs with with it . so that's something we have to keep in mind . if it isn't manageable budget-wise , we'd have to go over to to sim to simple buttons . we're going to sell tell ten millions of them . so bet big company in korea or taiwan , like samsung , can give us big discount on the chips , so usually , chips are aren't more expensive than one dollar . probably , but but , that's that's that shouldn't shouldn't be that big issue . so that that shouldn't be real issue , . i'll i'll i'll just add , put big summary here , so we could discuss it bit . what what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ? you should use kinetic as back-up . you you you should we should combination . you use the battery and charge it up with kinetic . when you pick it up , it charges up . like an aku acu , . just like the watch from seiko . what what do you think ? would prefer both too . that would bring the some more costs , but the who cares , . that's the project manager's problem . buy fifty cents battery and have something in my presentation to to cope with that . fifty cent , why doesn't and then we have single-curved versus double-curved . no , we'll we'll just and , plastic versus rubber . isn't possible to make combination with rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got . you , figured it will be rather than hard nah , rubber this is casing , . or do you rubber casing , . rubber casing , because you use an touch-screen , it's just casing around it . so , you could go for plastic , but figured would choose rubber . ask it now the question that have . is it possible of is it necessary to make touch-screen square ? it isn't , , ? that touch-screens are generally square . but it's the case you put around it that makes the shape . we're we put fashion in electronics , so we can . that isn't , that would cover it . but if you have square screen , and you put case around it that has like bulbs or that that covers part of the screen . that that's it's custom customisable and , me too . that that would solve the problem . so so so what are the opinions ? rubber or plastic ? you you you seemed to hesitate bit . as long as long as it's it's it's firm , and you don't it's not bendable , that goes too far . it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand no , that that that that's gonna the the chip set will hold it firm in place , and and and and screen also it might it might . it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . tra traditional versus , figured we we all set on that . and , then also the simple versus advanced . figure if we go for l_ , we we should have the advanced . so that shouldn't be problem . that's my , you're welcome . can do my thing ? it expert map . do your thing , tim . do your thing . bring it on . last week went to paris and milan for some trend-watching . our research and development department and went to paris and milan . in paris and milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays . our main audience , so that's people below forty , prefer the following . at first , the colours of fruit . very basic colours , like janus explained . fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow . considering material , . they like spongy material , like sponge-ball . like soft material . janus mentioned it also . he did some some findings himself . the teletubbies sh , you could . you wer you weren't in paris ? like big flashy colours . our secondary audience , people above forty forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . materials like wood that no just just no , , but just just wooden look . but wood is not not material you which you build remote control of . you you could . but never seen one . wooden look , . like you have those fake fake panels on the floor . the that isn't wood anyway , but ? but , that's our secondary audience . so , we decided to take the people below forty . so , that this doesn't apply . there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . they have to look fancy . they should be technological in innovative . that means there have to be fancy things in . and easy to use . but that's common . my personal preferences . we have to aim at mu at the main audience . and , therefore use fresh colours . would you prefer that you can choose the colour of your remote control or . i'll i'll come to that in second point . here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . to customise your own remote control . like the nokia the removable covers , just put red on it and go to the shop and buy green one . third , material being used could be like rubber . it fits within the current market trends . and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it . so to come back to your question , and the people in milan and paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard . like seen on regular mobile phones . actually , they have lot in common . the phones and the . actually saw phone that you could use as remote , so . you could use your remote as phone . that might be next step . there are numbers on it , so so that you say s_p_s_s_ , and it goes to . in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition . it's very innovative . you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and . but , we have to keep the cost in in mind , but it , it it can be very expensive . twelve fifty when your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else . building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users . also the link with mobile phones . but you don't use that games when you watching television , . no , but no , . but you don't use games when you're when you're making telephone call . it's just the same . when you're at college . you take your remote with you to school . you take your remote control with you . you al you also take you take your ipac and go play games . do that , but , and and third , stick with it , the log-in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to new dimension . the interface contents . that's just simple powerpoint mock-up want to make it more as dynamic for you so i'll draw there . but , the main concept is take one big touch screen . always display the primary buttons clear and visible . even li like this with uses of lot of space . and make the menu structure changeable . so if you press system , that's , multiple system options can , five or ten or or one , can fit in . or even step further when you want to have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . and other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary . and , how do do we want to look at does remote look , it's you've gotta hold it in one hand . so the middle like all remotes have to be in little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . and some remotes you can use with your thumb . but that's too difficult for this one . so you can make it little broader . and use your thumb on the on the main buttons . and use your other hands on the menu structure . so here are gonna be the program buttons . one , two , three , four , et cetera . and the the volume control and program control . and , down here , , added , this could be one big . the menu structure . so you can use it in in this way . one thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . know that if you are changing the menu structure here , and , still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . but if you're programming the colour of the t_v_ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . just keep it as simple as as possible . and do not use too many levels . do not have to select screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and push plus twenty times . but just the just in one button if possible . and , , you kn you all know the t_v_ levels . channel one , two . and when you get to to to ten , ye and want to go back , you have problem . just most most modern t_v_s , you you press one zero , and it goes to ten . and else , to one and through after that . so the button less . and , things like teletext , put them in the menu . what do you think about back-and-forth come-up button ? , find must trying to tell it . like in internet explorer . is volume plus and minus ? and this is program plus and minus . but does it that is for going from four to five . but if you go from two to eight , and you want , and on two . or if you're watching studio sports on on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two yes , that's good idea . that you can switch switch easy . but , my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . and if you're using that button lot of times , the menu will still be displayed on the screen . you just don't have to play games in-between . but if you're really switching between two channels , you won't have time to use the other options . already already told that . that's my conclusion . we can discuss little about the the three revolutionary things tim came with . the parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . there's not too much decision on that one so that parental control is good function to to put in the remote . how you think about it . agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . system properties , parental control . but what see how see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like windows log-on screen with parents , children . something like that . and when you want to use the parents option , you have to , . it it has to be fast . you don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and twenty seconds for for the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . no but most people find it much more important that their children don't watch sex or violence on the television , and ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can finally watch it because of that . you may use like when there's x_p_ , simple log-on , you just push one or two or three . pu push parents . and if you push parents , then . that then then then you have to go to three-digit log-in . to log in . and if you puts ye . like two one three . and it's in . and if you you push children , you don't have to log in , but you can only watch children's channels or . it automatically goes . if it's worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it . because t's simple function , but it's gonna take lot of resources and lot of time to programming it . because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such . and i'm not if it's actually worth investing that much time and effort into it . what but , , if you want to if we in incorporate the parental control , let's say we do , and and whatever , cho child just goes up to the t_v_ and presses up . that's there's big market for it , because you , you read many times in magazines same , and you heard on the news that that he , they believe that children are influenced by the television , and , we're we're aiming to below forty years . but there are lot of people will below forty who have children in young age who who want to not watch violent or . some idea on that . just make through remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the things to do . just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles . that's that's better idea ? it just has to be when it's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . but if you want to install it personally if got kids , and could choose between two remote controls . one with parent control and one without , and would would buy the one with . with and one without . , still some question have about how to incorporate those ones . you're thinking about some channels they cannot see , but , when , , for the for all the standard channels , and only for after ten o'clock in the evening violent films and movies will come and some some timing will be needed instead of of channels , because if you're watching , , you're in the at day , cartoons will come up on friday night . it can work with show view . you you can control your video recorder with show view . when you tick in number , it will start and end recording . but there's some option that that the show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out . the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all , will have to decide that isn't possible . but but that isn't possible . nob nobody's stopping the child from checking the channel . you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but . but that , i'm not because for that to happen , you you will have to receive signal from the remote control , so it would , , have to be constant constant signalling . what what may be better is to incorporate an separate device that that you can program with the remote control . and that provides parental control , . and that's just an optional device . so there's that's there's besides the remote control , you'll have separate ? wouldn't put it in an optional device . that that then then then it becomes too much , . if we do it , we we must do it in ways that like profile , parent profile , and family profile , and otherwise . and and and when you install another device , children can still go up to the t_v_ , pop open the thing and and and go to channel . on separate menu option . that's true , but at same instant , same happens when you have remote control . so but , only difference is the the people buying the remote control will now get the added feature of parental control , and those people wouldn't necessary want it . so , you you'd be . but it's just an an added feature feature . and what do you think of the games in the voice recognition ? personally think that that becomes too much . , mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . it's more like it gets you to the functionality , but . but don't think when you're watching t_v_ , hearing loud noises from the t_v_ , someone screaming one , and you the channel switches , . like voice recognition is too much , . see games happening . you can put it on chip anyway , so as long as it's isn't primary feature of the remote , but optional in but how we do it ? that that doesn't that doesn't co , that that doesn't cost lot of extra resources , . so that will that that that must be in it , you think ? that will be . so the games are in it . the voice recognition are not . and the parental control are optional ? it's it's in it . but too ma so , but . also it's good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . so we should make it too complex . is some menu function , you choose parental control , and four files will emerge from menu where put it on . but how how it's gonna work will be problem . but will there like the first idea from you can buy it without and with parental contr control ? or are we going to put it in and just ? ye best would be to put it in and make it an menu option . to put , to put it in always . you can put on . and you can just when you buy it , you can select personal preference , parental control on , and the password . figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with receiver in it . so you could actually easily build in parental control . but it would would be more expensive . so , and that that way you could make cheap model and expensive model . could ma make the simple model and the deluxe model , . but t_v_s aren't capable of sending . yes they are . they were just able to receive . you yo , but most often not . you you have some t_v_s any . that is true , that is true . you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . and there's just some little clock in the remote . you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control . just some rules . but you still have the problem about the television itself . no , no , it's very simple . there i've seen some of remotes who have clock in it . so , the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock . but , on the t_v_ at least my t_v_ , is is compartment which you can press . and there are buttons behind it which you can use , if you if you don't if you don't have . that's to put it very blunt , that's not our problem . just have the parents buy some glue and it's not not part of the remote . that is true . that is true . you have to . you could you could you could go like that that would actually make things lot more easy . or make it ourselves very diffic . you could just blame it on television and make it their problem . figured figure we could do that . i'm not what marketing thinks about it , but user profile . have to consult my legal advisor about it . so we have decided on the things that from janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . the case will be double-curved and rubber , in fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable . the buttons will be touch-screen . but there may not be too many buttons . and in the the menu structure , there must not to be five minutes to go . too too many levels . and it must be easy to use . the parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . and the games are in it . so we have we have decided , . have one thing left . it's handy to build in an expert view and simple view . like like moat or . what was thinking about is just menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . like at in the experts view , you have lot of more buttons . but you have that in the . and when you push system properties , entire list pops up with ev all you can program . you use the . it's already incorporated little in that concept . you you could actually build in function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users . wh which buttons you like or not . which buttons do you want to in it . because you can you can like build in back-forward button , and some po somebody would just want to watch two channels . just leave the other numbers away . you could you could have people want want that . we take it to the other meeting , ? have little little chat to do and then we finish . went to master class and two things are are can come in handy for us . first thing is we talked about knowledge management . knowledge engineering and the fact that that that the idea of knowledge , sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is like that . it's it's very hot at the moment , so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other marketing or did said management ? just talking about myself . that's my function , to . what other companies had to also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on newer remote , just some . and another one . som some bench-marker . they're ha they're at , benchmarking , that's the word saw . couldn't , another thing is there were there there was survey , and it came out that people like to buy things from single large provider , instead of those who are partnering with us . so , we must we must bring it as if real reaction is is big company , trustful company , and it has . how know marketing name for our product . to the third power . real reaction remote . had had another idea to put the whole the whole idea of real reaction and single brand and that thing . when you put on remote , you see just like when you telephone , you see little animation . real reaction remote . and with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . and then you go the . , but it has to be like split second , because you have to put in code also and . you can show somebody logo for point five seconds , they'll still remember it . and it it linger on every time you see it . but the idea from this thing is that we must present it as as we are single large provider who will stand on our own . if you if you have the screen , you can you can have small logo at the bottom . and it could just stay there . that spins around like all the time . that spins around . but we we are . it it's just like globe in internet explorer . something like that . but think about that things . it's for , for the next meeting , ? that's what they said in the master class . next meeting starts in thirty minutes . who who who gave you the master class ? so you can go to paris and milan once again . the master class ? very special , next session . idea that you the the industrial development centre and user interface will work together on prototype . and will drawing it on the smartboard . so that's kinda new thing . and , the marketing expert will will ke he will be keeping busy with the product evaluation . but the most specific instructions will be sent to you by email . stay here and p_ . so we're going to work together now ? the , dids this what what heard . not in the master class . in the master class . so you just for the specific instructions and but it was very very good session , gentlemen . no new email . and give me good evaluation . too , lord . lot of success . see you in half hour . but keep an eye on your laptops for real , but there's there's still the my instructions that you will work together . i'm not if we we because saw something about individual actions . that's not my problem . if you got no . so stupid manager . the project manager always works alone . do you have new email ?
wouldn't wanna be project manager . what we going to do . once again i'm gonna take minutes . so , no presentation for me . first we have prototype presentation by and . j_ and j_ . afterwards some eval eval evalu evaluation . evaluation crit criteria . in combination with the finance received an an excel file which we have to fill in later on . and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and half euro . so , that's that's big so let's it we have we have must , we must have some time for that because it will be , quite lot of mathematics . that's gonna be problem . and after that , an evaluation of the process how we how we have done it here with the smartboard , with the with our laptops , with the all all this . and afterwards , we closing . once again , forty minutes , so let's start . would give the word to and for the prototype presentation . shall give short introduction and then . j_ and j_ . j_ and j_ . jane and jane . j_ and j_ , . take it away . take it away . this was our first concept . we decided to use single touch-screen . so , we've worked out this concepts , how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and and . and , , we began with with form of shape , that is is easy to hold in one hand , left or handed . so , we made it little bit less thick and it has some ar artistic meaning . this isn't nothing . idea is better . during the meeting showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and the menu structure , if necessary , with your other hand , so it's just gonna hold it easily . and it has to be acce accessible with your other hand too , . so we began working out concept . , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel screen . these would be the main buttons , you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to . but , t's standard they will be delivered with this set-up . we have the more advanced menu setting here . we have the sub-menus and stu . we made top , or front view . just so like you wanna back view . as you can see , this there , there are two weird bumps in it . this is for the added effect of youth and dynamic . and this is for the artistic effect . what we figured is we'll show you picture later on you have more better idea after that . but , idea is for to stay in balance with these two with these two . and so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . it won't roll around or . but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone , or like these old phones . you you may get the idea . so thi this is about how we figured it should be . the panel we you would hide with some more rubber layers , like we discussed early on . you would you wouldn't see the straight panel , but more fluidly and round . the panel just goes like this . but the overlaying layer is little bit curved and . and , in these bumps you could actually put some electronics that would you can make more thinner design , and that would actually look very , . and , about the colour , what have , , as colours , do you do you have the picture in . we added that this can be held with your hands for this maximum is om , one and half centimetres . so , you have room here for your battery and even other electronic chips . and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip . now , this is the idea about the bumps . you can see there's very youthful dynamic exterior . it you just want to hold it you you are young and dynamic like us . 's it's like an easter egg . it's like an but this is for children . we we want more adult version . but , this is like remote control for children . it's called weemote weemote . that's actually brilliant marketing stand . but so this actually basic the idea . what got in mind . we we just want to build more adult vers adult version of of this . and and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey . those are the technological colours actually , so it or blue or whatever . it would be best to to appeal to broad public and make the covers exchangeable , so the young people will buy an orange and red and blue and purple , but when the older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control , it would be less appealing than white one . and young people , we think , are little bit more flexible , they think , i'll buy for couple of euros some noi hip , cover is necessary , 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the screen . it's an idea to sell it without cover , so that you can pick cover in the in the shop . so , there must be some cheap standard cover , white , that's could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money . but you you mustn't forget that our target aim is younger people . we had decided to put some flashy fruity colours in it , and in the survey from milan and paris it it came out that the the older people are more willing to to spend money on extra features . so it will be better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as as standard , and for the people who really want more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay that . the other way around , you mean . they want they want more luxury , but they have the money to do it and they want to to buy that . so , it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as standard . , perhaps you're . would would actually agree with this sounds logical . an another idea . we could develop cover with wood style . they'll the elder users as . colour of wood style , white and couple of hip fruity colours . and lea delivered standard with fruity colour , but not too not too much . not not too . this is banana and mango , not not purple or orange and yellow . but , the mai the standard must be some attractive flashy colours . or blue or . not too , but little , because that's our aim . li like like this like this . this isn't this isn't too much , is it ? the buttons don't have to be all all of . the buttons , , something like this would be . except for the buttons it's it could be standard model . that's that's it from us . it's my time now . it's my turn . the marketing expert . during the design design life-cycle we we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and . now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to to the past requirements . so we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . we're going to do that with seven point scale . opening word document now . one , , have to expla explain something . we have to be consensive about about things . so , it has to be group group decision . so we gon we gonna evaluate the , the the thing we saw . we're going to vote . the remote control is designed for people with age below forty . seven is false . one or most true ? it's not just designed for people under the age of forty . it's also designed for people above forty . so so one is appropriate ? so have i've , two or three , because it's not just the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . or , more like four . no no , little more in the middle . no , three or . but it's also designed for people of age above forty . so , i'll say it's about three . it will be primary appealing to to minus forty , but also appealing to . but also for , . the remote control is beautiful . acco according to us , it's one ? or , of you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your own product . it's the marketing angle on television . we have wonderful . it's also fancy then . the remote control looks fancy . we have perfect remote . the remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons . they have to agree but i'm the user interface expert . leads to user face , . teletext buttons and volume buttons ? no teletext buttons . teletext is in the menu . you you've different menu . and volume is impo . volume is true . big and clear ? the they are big and clear . big and clear . big and clear . but you could make teletext button six . otherwise , the people who read this are gonna think we have no teletext button . but but the teletext button . you can ch that's in menu . it's it's not , it five ? so , it's , it it it it isn't entirely unclear , but so , wouldn't give it seven . would give it more five or six . what do you think , mister project manager ? was thinking very black and white . black and red . don't forget to save it . when we put in fancy colours , and . the remote control is easy to be found . it has these all these fruity colours and it has strange shape . so , if you so if you have trouble finding it , then then i'll go for four . but , it it's not making any sound , have we deciding ? , but , look . so it'll make difference . if you put your normal remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ? we have the better re . my remote control's black . li little bit ? little bit , but . we we can do it glow in the dark . fi , five . so , if it's in the dark place , you still see it glowing . fo fo fo five is . it's it's it doesn't really make lot of four ? because four is between three and also between between true and false . so i'll i'll go for four . you must see it as , according to the the other remote controls , there may be there in your t_v_ room , this one will stand out , . yes , but five is between four and six . wha , that that's better question actually . it it's , . exa that that's what it's about . if your fifteen remotes in drawer , you find it , ? if it if this lying on your couch , you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange thing . but but the survey under users was that they really lost it . like , no not not seeing it , but lost it in the house . but when you lost it you're just not , mostly when you lose your remote control , it it's under your most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it . if if you see strange shape lying somewhere , then you'd recognise it as , whoa , that is strange . that's our remote control . what is that . agree , agree . eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours . would call choose two , 'cause we decided not to make two fresh colours , as it would not . , not too flashy . the remote control is made of soft material . kinda soft , but but not this . rubber , is soft . but not too soft we have decided . easy to use , very afford . easy to use . easy to use ? can it be zero ? don , it is it no . top easy to use ? it's it's not the most easy to use it can be easier . no , you can do two , because it can be easier . jus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest . but then you're , but then you'll lose function , functionality and our fancy look , so . but the most easy to use is just with one button on , , but easy not not the most easy to use , . but it is it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible . no , it's it i'll go for two . my vote's on two . we also have to compare it to the to the remote controls on the market nowadays . so , i'm hurrying . but waits just minutes . what's the time ? we also have to do the evaluation , the production costs and . these are the regular remotes . the remote control is innovative . yes , true , one . you're agree , tim ? you haven't seen more innovative thing in paris ? the remote control has remova removable from multilux . yes , one . the remote control , it has speech recognition . yes , it , they are built in . this is used with speech recognition , this . the remote control has built-in games ? but , make it two , because the games are in sub-menu and not it's not an entire game . but they are built in , so it's one . and the last , paren parental advisory function . you really like the parental advisory . yes , do . did you make this or the , it changes it . bu , he made it . will do the the math . now it's your turn . we have now to to calculate the production cost . if it's under twelve and half euro , then it's . but is it if it is ? no , this isn't . if they're under twelve fifty . if they under . cau 'cause so it's . if the costs are under twelve and half euro , then we can ra move on to the project evaluation , as we have experienced it . otherwise , we have do have to do little redesign thingy . so , we have to fill in the numbers of the component components . we have to fil , want to do it in and see if we stay under the twelve and half euro . so , do we have hand dynamo ? me , too . battery , yes . battery , one ? kinetic , one . kinetic , one ? solar cells , zero . simple chip on print ? no , advanced chip . sample sensor sample speaker ? no , the advanced chip is . advanced chip is three . three euros , . we have one . but it it's one one thing , it's three euro . we have one . one piece , . no , sev zero . what's the sample sensor ? that's , speech recognition and zero . speech recognition , . you give it sample , one . but is it it's not made from single uncurved thingy and then and then no ? so it's only once double-curved . yes , three . 'cause the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the on the the back of the , we don't have anything else . we're now in problem , 'cause we have reached eleven euro yet . so could you step little to the ma . but we have . just go on . just go on . then we'll see we'll we'll see wha how much we are over budget . or and zero . titanium , no ? special is the special colour ? no , this is standard colour . yes , this is special colour . but but but daniel , tha that's that's another brand . but we want to make the wood colours , that , one . if if you're honest , we'll type one , special colour . that's an add-on . that's another article to sell . but we we going to , that's true . but , it's it's it , the push-button , no . we'll finish the the list first and then look back , aye ? that doesn't account for this . scroll wheel , no . scroll-wheel , no . yes , one . button , no . no , the the we don't have no . is it no . we're only four euro over budget . but , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved . so , what's the thing we can change ? can say something ? no , can say something as project manager ? just cut off the kine . the kinetic thing , can we just skip it , because you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative . we just put good battery it it . mobile phones nowadays . daniel , what do you think about here . what do you think about putting battery in it , but also selling like the covers , docking station just apart from the from the thing , so that you can put rechargeable batteries in it and just , , . but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you you have to recharge them manual . and not really . but we if you forget about the kinetic , we do that , we shall . just an idea . that's cost reduc . you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . so , but but the single-curved is just , , . and that would solve the budget problem . so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then no , it's it's just one curve and not back curved . it's just , the single-curve that . or or are these two curves ? so that's wh tha that's one option . but what else do we have to cut out ? and then , and then we could have it , but it's its' t's it's it is the main point of the the the the look . we going to cut , we just make it flat . no advanced chip , that's little bit of problem . no , tho that that can be done . so , , little less conversation . although , can we make it with regular chip ? those ar arcs , why are there for ? the blue blue . fill in just explanation . delete it for you if you want . but does it fit with our design ? no , no no . so , if we do this , we're on twelve and half euro . and we're done . do we have to adapt it ? the only thing that don't , single-curved , but there's curve in it . could we just make the bubbles cut off the back , and then we're has . so , it's really static value . but , wha , look , what is the if you make it double-curved , it costs one euro more . but , you do function . but no , but does it have lot of extra fun function more like . you make it optional . worth , does it have added worth ? there's an athe aesthetic value , but not functionality . no , , let's assume it is . you make like eleven and half euros profit instead of twelve and half . but if twelve and half is fixed fixed price . no , we can't go above that . we we should assume it that it is . but figured that the kinetic would be marketing promotion . if you promote kinetic kinetic remote control , , that would sell better than an normal remote control . do you think ? now you can shake your remote control . no , , , you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my remote control is kinetic . you have standard old battery control remote con true . what what about all the the environment freaks ? not freaks , the envi no . but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile . so you ma can make an an especialised extra gold version . it's it's it look like this one . who because if you want to go to kinetic , you're you're on thirteen and half and you must go to flat , and now it's it's more of compromise thing . and if you make the single curve ha just big curve , then it's then it's , one big good curve . just one big curve . was going to say nasty words , but don't . this is strange by the way . wood is is is is cheaper than rubber . we thought that wood would be more expensive . this american figures . you just cut down some trees . but that this is this is it ? this is it . this is it . whoever makes remote control out of titanium . i'm gonna save it . it is possible , but you can't use double curves for titanium . that's one of the functionability , you two , especially you and and daniel , you you you both had the less creative roles in the project . , considering we have , we were above , so we did little redesign , now it's about time to talk about this project . no , we have to do all those hours again . costs on no redesign . we , we'll start her all all over again . were there room for was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ? for us , there was lot of creativity . that there was lot of room for it . but , that's mainly because of the information that was delivered to us . it was just fixed information and get your from there , and couldn't go on on on the internet and search my own . agree with that . 'cause jeroen and , we had more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two . we could just sign up an remote if we liked . how about the leadership ? leadership was crappy . nah , the leadership wasn't crappy , it was the leader that was crappy . no , the leadership was . now we're done . example of crappy leadershi , . no , leadership was , the first meeting was little bit of unstructured meeting . it was good . you could have but , it was your first , no no disrespect , but you could have structure it little bit more . so like , was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and . you could of said , shut up you fool . but about me . notice it too . was was also very unhappy , very unsatisfied about the about the first meeting . so , hope the the the other meetings get better and the the last two meetings also we we reached some good decisions about talk . you made up . try to learn from your mistake . and we will never do it again . no , it you did better . more more consensus . ev everybody was agreeing every . much more constructive . that's only , it's for us , because . we work together on project , but everybody has his own task . and it's more like presentation and some points were discussed . so , it is little bit . but , really teamwork were you two the ? no , it went . that went it went . it's it's just nah . no hard feelings . stupid stupid pen , but , but but draw something difficult . we we had some trouble with the pen , but , but us . now you you must push little while . just write your name now . try to write your name , in in writing letters , , ? normally , this the block letter sign it , ? just just write your name in in one line . if it's little bit too small bit quicker now . it didn't he he knows how it works , . you can be you can go quicker , 'cause then it it won't notice it . follow the master class for the smartboard , so that's the that's the main issue . so about this one you were you're dealing with , the the the the digital pen . the the idea is , but it doesn't work properly . digital pen , the first time did individual work , used it . but , and the first two meetings brought it with me , but didn't use it after the first the first meeting . no , have it working . but , , no , it doesn't have that much added value to the . it's it's not real real use for me . as as said few moments ago , it would like , myself , to write with normal pen , because must , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . it's the same concept as the pen , where you have to download the software or very slow . and it is still your own handwriting popping up in word . no , and it doesn't give any added value . no , that's true . not really , no . and the smartboard is useful , but the the pen is not user-friendly , . be it it takes lot of time to draw things and to write things , and that's the , but that's not the the you when you at foreign audience , you don't gonna wr write small . and it's it's not very precise . we're trying to to , it may , and tr try to wri write your name in in normal size , . like when you do this . just like when you're writing on letter . no , as you saw on on this drawing , just open open this one or that one . it's it it , we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it's almost impossible to get clear when you're and the eraser was another problem . but there's some function with no , it isn't . it is is this large . and when you try to erase this line , i'm gonna erase my name there . i'm gonna erase my name . it's big big eraser . abo what new ideas ? the the idea of the touch-screen is i'm just what what . new ideas about the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or hello . did you heard what he said ? have some figure . the eva the evaluation , the the mean number is one point eight one point eight six . so that's fairly fairly good , . because what does it mean ? that all the requirements are true or very true , . all the mo , are between one and two . but the new ideas found for wi with working with this software ? not really , just they have to improve it . not really , ? the concept is , but it has to be quicker . it is still opening my programme , almo almost my entire computer is locked up during the process and it , , just takes too many time . people will still feel the need to to write it quickly on page and not download it and save it , and more user-friendly . you had expected it to to be more more . 'cause when you use pen , you can just draw like you draw normally , and you do . may the idea you proposed is screen here . and draw it , and it's it's placed over there . that would be easier . or at least when you you don't have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . and now you have to keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen . and that's very bad concept . nah , , it's my opinion that , it's can be saved easier . but this is better than regular flip-overs , but . but if you're in normal flip-over you lot of people write text . there's no text option . and writing text , , you've gotta really do your best to write some . and and some functions for circle or square . you have to draw it yourself now . or even insert picture . if you have some presentation , and you have some . or text function . just type text , and that that would be excellent . but insert image isn't available ? 'cause then you could , . picture from scanner , clip-art . that that can be done already . but not the the the the predefined squares ? so you can with w_w_ dot google dot com . what if you do like hyperlink ? type type it ? re real reaction dot n_l_ . yes , is now is . you'll just make link in . there's one way to if if you're not using the eraser something else , arrow . is it here . here , that . so you have as you saw , you have little , you can , . you can go there . so there the the the functionality is there , but it's not it's not ideal , and it's it's very it costs lot of time to to use . to use , . and that's pity , if you if you have thirty , forty minutes for this things , and we are now with four people , but it , imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone . and that's that's mostly the case , from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , and if you have to do all this kind you'll rather use powerpoint and work it out in advance . two minutes of drawing , . and the one or two things you have to draw when you're there , just use flip-board . what really miss also is is is turtle is decision decision system like with the evaluation , you have to polls like , what do you want , one , two , little application like give your own number and click one two three four five six seven . just like he said with the with the screen which you can write , also voting mechanism . ju ju , voting application . just little group group decision application . but , problem is , you can't discuss anything you you ca you can , but you will discuss lot less than like we did now . we one one person said three . but , we said , no think two , because this and this , and then you can react on it . but if you you put three on it , just figure , everybody knows what i'm knowing , so they'll all just put two on . but , you can still discuss about it , but but click it in an application , that's lot easier to process . but it would . the for processing part . but then , the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it , that isn't that bad idea , actually . not that your opinion isn't valued , but but still . so , just about , because , tomorrow ? yo , manager . when are when are we going to produce it ? the costs are within the budget . the project is evaluated . but , before we going to celebrate , have little question which you can't answer , because there must be some end report . am busy with the end report now . you might thinking what the hell was he doing about all the meetings , what we have decided , report of this day . what is an end report ? that must be made , but , here is standing whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is , that that can be done . you ha you have ten minutes left , read . you have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report . we can do it together . you can see what i've ? so will put it on story-board . you can see it . you you already made beta version , or pages . because it will it must be , it's three with seventy five , just about . seventy five pages . do you want chair ? no no no , i'm just you can you can read it and here here it is . so you you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ? this not nit it read-only . but it's not fully finished yet . five minutes for finishing . this is about the functional design , the things . management expert , you have to change that . i'm when said it , remember had it here . it's read-only version . but you can save it the under another name . marketing expert , . about the three functions where which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control . it must be simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . so , this is really about wh what kind things must be in it and . one two three . understand you , talk little bit dutch . no , you have to put , switch channels at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second nay , volume changing , second . oka , , really didn't knew that . so , this one's first . switch , yes . you go there and you go there . then do it one two three . yes , very good . if the order is in is is important , that's the word for . then the conceptual design . all the things we have discussed , the energy , which turn out to be batteries , so that's , because . , you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost . he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable . it's not double . it's not double anymore , ? not double anymore . nay but that this is what . was initial , the plan . the initial plan . and the the added functions like tetris snake , it's under the parental control , the touch-screen . on thing one small thing , the added functions . so , it's just summary of what we had discussed , it's very cheap , you you you you you you come at it's very necessary . was it included in the cost ? it's very cheap . it's very cheap . no , it's it's not very cheap , but that no , but it's development inside corporation . like , we don't have to buy parental control . our own people can make that , . but it still has some . it it has some cost , but . but so we can discuss that we can discuss that things with the with the the board of what's it what's the company called ? he'll do it in his free time . so of directur or directors . keep forgetting it . real real reaction . real reaction , . you can ask your personal , the end conclusion . so anybody misses something here about , , that's that's what i'm gonna write between now . but , the decision to make the buttons on the top , and the menu on the on the bottom . still the end conclusion . that's all , . but , in here nothing . and clearly , touch-screen you've mentioned . touch-screen i've mentioned . but but the the decisions are put in the conclusion , . why we decided to use flat . , gonna redesign something now . because it will , five minutes from to finish meeting . before you change anything you save it first . you can't you can select file and export and then those j_ peg files . but then you had the same thing . and we have , another blank one . example of children remote . did we change anything ? it's new commercial logo . don't save it , aye ? that's , tim . why are only the first five smartboard files saved ? finish meeting now . i'm i'm i'm going to finish my end report . hereby is the meeting is finished . am the one who can say that . hereby the meeting is finished .
