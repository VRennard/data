we're ready to begin . my name's adam duguid , we're here because of real reaction , , we have in the group , , go for it mate . would you like me to spell that ? and your role is ? i'm the marketing expert . you're the marketing expert , . next we have ? and your role in this is ? and , lastly we have ? and you're going to be the user interface , is it ? user interface defin designer , yes . this is the agenda for today's meeting . as you can see , opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . we already got through opening , and partially through acquaintance . so , the reason we're here , we're gonna design new remote control , as you probably all know . the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . course , we'll have to go into bit more detail than that , but personally that the original is gonna be very key aspect to this design . there's lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . this is how today seems to be going to work . we're gonna have the three phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . first one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is detailed analysis of our design so far . you've all got the similar emails , believe , . what can say ? ebenezer , you wanna have you wanna draw your favourite animal ? will make this quick , since we don't have much time . so it's not the best picture in the world . here we have an elephant . first point , begins with an , same like ebenezer . also , elephants have very good memory , much like myself , and 't remember back when used to live back in nigeria , but used to have pet elephant . so elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have memories , and they begin with the letter , just like ebenezer . tarik , would you like to have shot at bit of artistry ? , you can clip them to your belt . you ga the little the the that's good , we can clip them on . do we take them off ? you should also have your the lapel mic on as . there was this microphone as that you just somewhere so . now where do put the is this supposed to be clipped as ? the , it's just across there , that's it . it'll follow you if you you can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , wouldn't worry too much . there you go . should have good range . destroying your elephant here . here we have tiger . i've always loved tigers . they're just they're big , they're biggest cats , did project on cats in the wild when was kid and it was my favourite cat , just 'cause it was looks the best , the stripes , orange . my dad used to talk about he's from bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when was kid . and they're just the most feared of of animals in the wild . so that's why like them . didn't say an anything about me really but . excellent , very much . dave , if you'd like to have dash . the monkey , . the one this is somewhat oblique reference to my have three three year old daughter who who who who is affectionately known as miss monkey . monkeys have attitude . which is good thing . and fr and from from the point of view of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . so like monkeys . and and thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most . hardly what i'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now . also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . as you can see , twelve point five euros per unit . that's not terrible lot as far as i'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . if we're aiming for fifty million euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made , . fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold . now we better actually just get on with the the meat of the project . so i'm gonna that we've all used remote controls . any ideas of where you think new remote control could go into this market ? one thing i'm aware of is , there at the very high price end of the market there's there's emerging market for touch screen remotes that can be programmed in much more sophisticated ways than conventional models , so you get the you get you you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get much greater degree you get in these three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to much greater extent , and you can have one one macro to turn the turn the t_v_ to the channel , get the re rewind the tape in the v_c_r_ and get it to play once it's rewound , . it occurs to me there might be niche for for remote that aimed towards some of that functionality but using just conventional push button design . and therefore putting it into much lower price bracket . , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for touch screen would probably be possibly out of our . but you think again something to control multiple units in simple fashion . wouldn't like to say you you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could operate between multiple units in more integrated fashion . some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for running macros . would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the t_v_ , the sound system as , all in one go , is that , that sounds like good strong idea . let's say , or you pr you press say the play button for the d_v_d_ player and it turns the t_v_ on and onto the channel as , . i've noticed that gaming is becoming quite popular with television , when was younger we used to play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and the remote control was not keyboar , keypad , for playing games . any takes on this ? so perhaps one that was more specialised for game playing or interactive television . they they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or to record things . instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide bar to say what time it begins , and slide another bar to say what time it ends , that's , it's it's taken out the you don't have to be really clever to use remote control . i've heard i've seen the bar-code design before , . for gaming , you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and , shoot . you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and like that . 're beginning to run out of time now , so , we've got couple of ideas , we can we'll have to work fast , , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , , how the user interface might work , that'll be key aspect especially if the idea of some macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have lot of response back , or at least some kind . and we're gonna try and have to figure out what the user wants , yes . what the user wants . has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ? when you're talking about gaming and , do you think they should have some stick on it , rather than buttons ? like control pads , of games , but or is that bit ridiculous ? don't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as , so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . and that could allow easy navigation , used as joystick as . the other key feature that that would be good idea built into it is is is to make something fairly ergonomic , something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . but , al al also allows for the possibility of more slightly unconventional or attractive sha shape for it overall , . so , small , stylish , and something that's just little different . something sl slightly biomorphic in form , which it would need to be to conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway . that's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily . would would have hoped so anyway . i'd say we finish this one up , we get started , i'll get in , i'll write up what we've quickly done , and i'll get that out to everybody . as far as i'm aware we leave the microphones here , unless we get told otherwise , and just take the laptops with us .
just put it on the deskt desktop . no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's project documents link . actually just there . project documents , . if you dump it in there . what's your username ? what's your username and password ? there we go . hopefully that's us ready to to go . functional design meeting . we'll have to flesh out some of the . we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . not lot thankfully to say . we introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of macro facility , interac interacting the t_v_ bit more , mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , and ergonomics of the remote control as . it's come to my attention the following . teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . remote control should only be used for the t_v_ . due for time to market and possibly also cost issues . also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , your colour and slogan is down at the bottom there . just to say quickly would have thought that only being used for television the macro facility may now not be required . or at its functionality would have been of limited use . so to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . if anybody disagrees we can definitely say so . and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . i'd like to if possible hear from our marketing expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . so i'll just load up your presentation from here if you want . sh would you like to i'll just do it from here . is yours the . try second one . try it , . put in my last name , not , but . if you that's all . if you do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ? that'd be fine , that'd be . functional requirement by me ebenezer . so we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . we asked some open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got lot of good feedback . bear in mind this is only hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only ten people fifteen people in each group . so we got some the bad we got , remotes are often lost . often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me few minutes to find it . most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . remember trying to load d_v_d_ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me ten minutes to to go through each button , 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , there's just lot of that no one really uses . and if they do , not very often . takes too long to master the remote control . i've seen some remote controls that are big , they have lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they're just not to use . we just got lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . some of the good we got . between the age of fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . now don't get excited yet , i've got more to say on that . most people'd be willing to pay for that most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , they they want it to be different , everybody has white remote control with black buttons , and red button and green button , not everybody wants that . finally , my opinion . the voice recognition thing is . and voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . it's bit sketchy at some times , , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , but for very fixed number of words , you have , how many different words can you have for remote control , up , down , left , , channel five , channel seven , , how many , you can't have that many words . for fixed vocabulary it works quite . i'm pretty people would buy it . but after while people may wanna return it , because if you have to to say som most people use remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that's for flickering through channels . so if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do the time , then people might get bit fed up with that and they may return it . however , , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . but if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's lot of that you can get rid of . see , you could there're two options . either you have voice recognition by itself , which is bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or you have visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . so you can have voice recognition and regular remote . but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , , it could be like lollipop like that , something weird like that . as long as the voice recognition works , that's that's fine . so we have the three birds , we have the design , that we have the the fancy bit , , the voice recognition's fancy , it's , it's different , it's radical , so , and then we have an extra bit don't remember so i'm pretty people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have voice recognition system in remote control , is big question . will people will people be willing to for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause it will the remote will get better over time with the same user user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to , are you willing to have bad remote control . and what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the t_v_ , they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you . how do you account for regional accents and like that . will people return the remote control , lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , , so , do our audience have the money , but would they return it after while because it's not as fast as pressing button , it's not practical . if you could sor if you could speed it up bit , . these are things we should consider . it's , i'm ? if you could speed it up bit , . i'm about to end , . it's but there are definitely some considerations . hear from the user interface designer now might be an idea . you've got your presentation now , is it on the is it ? how did where did where did you get all your in information ? it's in the it's in the folder . there was website , , here . started making up , then got an email saying . this is brief run through of the of the technical functions of the remote . as is the the the presentation is already slightly obsolete because had in mind something that would be be aimed at controlling multiple devices but there's still of relevance , so press on . i've looked at looked at num couple of other remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . and wasn't really satisfied by what saw have to say so this is more springboard for how these could be improved on . the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . to save you getting off your backside . and there's two main trends in in the design practice . on the one hand and this this particularly relates to its earliest models where with so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set . giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . and most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates rather user unfriendly interface . and on the other hand there's user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used . with and and there is certain amount of loss of function here , but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . and so you go that's fairly intuitive to use , and the for the most part for t_v_ remote it's tha that would be channel control and volume . and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate control of d_v_ d_v_d_ or v_c_r_ presumably into that then there's play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , . my own view is that we should definitely be going for user focused design . but the pro the problem with lot of the user focused designs that are about is that they make assumptions in advance about what what given user's going to want mo want to do from want it to do most . so , something that's something that is more programmable , that perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , liked ebenezer's idea of including joystick in that and possibly fairly minimal number of function buttons , and have disp you then have some basic display on it so that if you're cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what each direction of the of the joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . this is actually again slightly taking inspiration off of games controllers , the playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with distinctive geometrical shapes but the and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on those those functions are then further specified . and so it's taking taking the lead from that . if we could hear from our industrial engineer , or designer . was still working on , hadn't got it finished . click to save in where do have to save it ? if you look on the desktop you'll find that there's link to the project folder , or project documents . if you save it in there we can open it up from here . what i've done with it , i'm . i'm just closing it now . are you finding it or ? where i've saved it . like if you go to one , whichever one you were working , and you just click file save as . that's it there , . i'm responsible for working design , , this is the inside going on of the the remote control . so we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this this is what i've seen . the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , and then the dig digital signal is sent to the t_v_ . so , if you go to next slide , you'll see you'll see what do we need on the user interface . do we need many buttons , or do we need many light bulbs that could be easier to to realise which appliances are on or not . , or would that take too much power , would we need more components in there to supply the power ? the joystick is another thing , if we were gonna add that , , there'd be more components to deal with that . so we need to exactly what that's the design of the the the layout of the electronic design , but there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface . so , that'll be decided , . and the next slide . , if you go to the next slide then . used the it was mess , was just putting adding it together at the end there . don't worry about it mate . so you have the energy source connected to the chip , and the user interface contains everything . you have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , will contact the t_v_ and will have whatever device or d_v_d_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on . so do we need on the control different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ? what we should decide on that . i'm i'm interrupting you . are you is it ? no , it's finished , . we can probably skip that for now . so , we've had some put forward , along with the new user requirements , we've had lot of input i'd say so far . hear what the marketing expert's saying about voice activated control . however i've got couple of worries about that . the power required , and the ability to the cost , it seems like for an embedded system , this could us issues . you see that there's fairly robust services on computers via via voice , i_b_m_ do drag and dictate , but these require lot of memory and usually state quite advanced processor requirements . voice activation could be an interesting idea but that our ind industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it's not feasible . that's just my view now , however the idea of joystick and then an which has been put forward so far , it's almost like having small t_ not t_v_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , how much power an would take , but it might be quite low ? on the remote just telling you what's on , or , interactive or do you think that people will get mixed up , like , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then , , trying to get everything working , would it be bit confusing ? literally if you can imagine the display slightly larger than those on mobile phone , something where you can read an an fair amount of information , traverse quite few menus , if we used mobile phones as good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around . that could be one possibility . and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels we would agree with you . was thinking that the remote the default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume , left and for channels . probably for the first couple of hours of using it but muscle memory's wonderful thing , . and and that size of display was about what had in mind . though would say that we could probably probably be required to mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white . si si simply to keep keep the unit cost down . colour could be subsequent development but cost bit of extra money once everyone's got the first , , colour's out , we'll have to replace it won't we . it does nothing extra . that would be my feeling as , we could possibly create quite useful user interface . now don't , go for it . but the idea of remote with menu or and joystick like if was in the habit of buying remote controls then would want one , but we don't have specific audience , , like what is our target audience , what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner . what i'm saying , like , for whom is this intended ? it could probably be aimed at most people who've used mobile . and that might be just another way of saying try to target most people . most people , . if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be we're almost relying on their experience with mobile phone suppose . but that does cover very large section of the people out there . imagine as that the actual and to certain extent the joystick as would be for the additional functionality . which doesn't get used as often , it makes it easy for them to figure out how to change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it . and you can still have the main buttons thow the people to turn the machine on and off , up and down , it depends , we have the fol the joystick as separate one for the other functions then , that there's just small number of as you were saying buttons that have already been defined . so like we go for the standard up and down for and volume control . so that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still do do . and they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the actual owner of the the t_v_ and who would normally use the unit . the thing like about the the joystick is that you you you then you can then put it for for t_ t_ for t_v_ remote alone , you could put there are like say the the the main things people do with t_v_ remote control is the volume and the channel . you can pack all that onto was onto single control . but but the but then if if you if you wanted to access further functions you you then get to menu navigation . with things like ch with things like tuning and channels adjusting brightn brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most t_v_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be fairly rational way of integra integrating the the remote with the device it's controlling . concern about our market . if we are most of the of the replacement remote market is remote control rationalisation . you've got twenty different devices in your living room , you want one you want one that'll do the job of all of them . if all you're replacing is one of the however many remotes you have in your living room , you still need separate remotes for everything else . think that possibly . this is requirement that we have to stick to i'm afraid , this isn't one that i've just arbitrarily decided on . so this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now . so understand your point , and would agree with you , but this is our design spec for now . 'fraid to say . would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is separate unit . does that would that include access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ? that it would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now . and until we hear otherwise we should go with just that . we'll hear differently , but for now it would be ease of manipulation of certain functions , yes . so the joystick is just for differentness . there is that possibility , yes . then our market should be t_v_ manufacturers , rather than the public . try and sell it sell it to them to supply with , , i've seen them . however exactly where we'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the marketing expert , that might be sales , who are not in this meeting . it's just , the way figure it , twelve point five euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million like that , not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , , like if we made perf if we made ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell lot of remote controls . we just is this gonna be enough to to sell ? something else that you brought up was the ability to lose remote , which as you said you've done , we've probably all done . if it's gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is . had one of those , and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up because it it went off all the time accidentally . the other option is that the was going to say clapping , digital telephones , , one unit has you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's button , but it's button that you attach to the t_v_ . the clapping one . something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . and that could be something could separate us bit . that's good idea . that's good idea . and that way , because we're attaching what would be small button to the t_v_ , again say what , it would be small transmitter , watch battery type scenario would say , that if it was problems enough you could actually even just don't power that might be something that we could look into . we're just saying volume . it's putting lot on your shoulders there , so that could be something that separates us bit from the market as . to go on from here . we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get , this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique . do we go for remote contro , we're gonna go for remote control , do we go for small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the . should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ? we could use say the left and for changing channels and the up and down for volume , and . but we have frequency of how what people use remote control for most . power is used like once per hour , channel selection is used hundred and sixty eight per hour , that's by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that's like fourteen , and volume selection . vol volume selection , , the teletext we're gambling with , and we're gonna say it's dead , the way of the dodo so we , , we could even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , , and then what is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say ? no , , . so we're having very very few buttons involved , but navigation around menu for most things . actually how actually would say two two function buttons , the we're now using the menus button and and an og and an button . certainly something i've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that lot of the time the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for . or vice versa . and that's really irritating . the the the other dis design constraint we should bear in mind is that people are very much used to using remote control one handedly , , so we need to make that even with the joystick , something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb . so we're actually that sounds like rough idea . do we incorporate the idea of trying to locate the remote control again via beeping noise ? do you mind looking ? because it's so small it might be an if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that . the ability to locate it again . so that would require transmitter attached to the t_v_ , just so that it says find me , and what , small microphone on the actual unit , can hide it in the base . light bulb as , no ? so so small speaker you mean . some speaker , , . and light bulb ? us we might be better with the sound possibly we could incorporate the true fact , considering the cost of an l_e_d_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . nah , you'd see it anyway , if you hear it . those little key-rings have both , so . the l_e_d_s can be surprisingly bright now . blue ones particularly . plus that's wee design touch . so by the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design . because we're only going to have very few key and you've got small , joystick , it leaves you open to potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly . if you could look into what we've suggested so far , the feasibility of small transmitter , and such , if an screen requires too much power , or such . ebenezer , , marketing expert if , if you could as see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken , where of joystick to control the very basic functions , and then the idea of manipulating it like you would mobile . can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface , . you want the . how easy that will be within the time frame , but could be something we could look into . any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ? anything that they think has been missed out . bit of wide open question there . feel free to email me if you think that we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible . so should just look at the speaker , the speaker and an l_e_d_ . and , and transmitter . speaker and l_e_d_ for locating , , transmitter getting the external power source , , that's quite true . actually one one wee thought about that . if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the then the transmitter could actually be built into the television . and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as 'd say . the electronics could be either placed externally or internally , makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control , so that's good . uses gives us new potential market . if it if we get major television manufacturer to say we'll have that , save us the bother , then that's vast amounts of sales . one thing that we've almost not talked about , my apologies for that , , user interface , we also need to get the slogan in here , it's , i'm pointing at my laptop , what in real reaction , and such . the slogan is , the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics , isn't it ? no it could be , i've probably missed that . that's almost the last minute thing we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top . 's also look . so i'm not too concerned that we haven't gone into depth about that . but it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ? we might like to put slogan on , and possibly the two r_s to signify the company . rather than real reaction . the the the double arc could perhaps be the the enter button . and i'd say that that's us for now .
so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes . to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . that sums up the last one . so we'll just crack on , like to start with the industrial designer if it's possible . the con today is the concep today . i'll just have presentation saved it in the the folder . this meeting is the conceptual design phase and is about this . and is to cover things like what the parts might be made of , , can we outsource these from elsewhere , will we have to construct any items ourselves ? 'll just i'll load it up then . which one do , interface concept ? we've got trend watching , that's you . it's components design . the case le that's what wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . but later on we found out that it can be rubber as , or titanium or even wood . so we decide what it's gonna be . we need the infra-red transmitter . get that off the shelf . joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , could be plastic or rubber even as . if you go on to the next slide . if you go on to findings , it's like two or three slides down . so , this is what found we can use . three different types of batteries . can either use hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , that they use in watches , or else solar powered one . now , the kinetic one , we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it . the bat the battery for watch wouldn't require lot of power , would be my one query . is kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ? there's also watch moves around deal more . do you think ? which suppose as would allow us to go off the shelf again , you'd say ? and solar cells , about that . we should probably just use conventional batteries . just like in usual remote controls . and these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have . one is flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with double curved . the materials are tha there as you can see , but you can't have titanium one for double curved , which would be , and light . titanium , the really strong metal , titanium ? is it not also it's expensive ? so as , . they make mountain bikes out of that , don't they . so it's really light as . if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ? could you draw something ? you don't doesn't have to be perfect , it's just 'cause i'm not quite if understand the difference between the two . for curved , was thinking to for to sit in your the palm of your hand . like this , with the joy pad here . and an button around here , so that the thumb can use it quite easily . don't exactly double curved . it probably means this is probably double curved . whereas single curved would be like that . or not necessarily . so it might literally just be . whereas this is two curves . so that's what they mean by double curve . which it looks better than the single curve , but you can't have it in titanium , which is material . and for the buttons , it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com p_c_s . but it requires more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use it's even more expensive . so you have to decide , there's trade-offs there . if you want the buttons to be , if you have double curve control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as . but you're gonna ha reckon you're gonna have to have key number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . you wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . you wanna enter just the number of it , if it . so reckon we're gonna have to have number keypad anyway . do you think ? that was definitely something we can talk about . so you've got little bit about the the chip that we might require as ? so , depends where gonna spend the money if you want the fancy display . do you have any idea so far , like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an , does that in shoot the cost up by drastic amount ? need an advanced chip for the . is that did advanced , like three eight six advance . compared to say just pressing buttons . if you press button that sends certain transmission through the infra-red , whereas if we're controlling the we definitely require much more powerful chip . just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons is the the point being made . if i've not over-stepped . the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the remote control . should go on , or go back ? if we only have twelve pounds fifty , twelve euros , not even twelve pounds . twelve euros , what's that , like eight pounds like that , nine pounds ? 'd also be relying on the the bulk buying in producement and such . that's good point . we have to look into the costs of those . if you go to the one before that so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the t_v_ . the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then it'll send it to the tr the amplifier . and then the next slide just shows how the copper wires interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , to get sent to the chip . so that's just how the control works inside . we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use . so in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an looks ? we can do it if we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . and then use single curved case . because we might need it to be curved for the thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . and then you'll need the advanced chip for the . that sounds like quite good requirement to me . conventional battery would seem to make sense . i'm not if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and i'm about anybody else , but plastic or rubber as traditional form of casing would seem to be good way forward ? i'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber for reasons i'll go into in more detail . also have preference for rubber . , will we move on to user interface , and ? based on my research . as long as were you ? and interface concept . now i'm gonna have to work between the the slides and the and the white board 'cause actually have some fairly concrete things this time . was given an h_t_m_l_ file giving various ideas from from other previous remote control designs , and decided to just dump them all . wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re nothing saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . so what ra rather than looking at other remotes , ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . and try and and try and figure out way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , so that if if so that the finger is each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . so next slide , if you . and what we've decided on was the the the joy the joystick , two function buttons and the , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . don't actually think we need the the numeric keypad because if you because one of the menus that we could have available via via the is one where you scroll through channels , so if there's something and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for for di for digital or or for or for cable , whatever , you're looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then your v_c_ and then the channel through your v_c_r_ and or d_v_d_ player . and or box . so it's not i'm not really excessively concerned about that . you must have two two modes , basic mode , where the joystick's left left for channels , up down for volume , and the and the menu mode for further functions . now the reason was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have highly ergonomic design , it needs to be ergonomic for left or handed people . can jump in slightly there ? that would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then . basi what what the what be having , would say , the the whole thing articulated at two points , so that if you if you're handing it from lef left or handed user you can adjust it so that the the l_c_ the and the the joystick would be in the place . and also this is rather nicer de design gimmick that the the the whole thing it should have organic feel to it that it should be , , soft to touch and can be moved around all . on to on to the next to the next slide . just to let we'll probably be quite tight for time as , because you've probably got lot you'd like to say , . add pretty pictures to this . the assuming the hand the hand to be in about this position , hol holding the remote , the the joystick unit should rest over the the joint of the of the four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . and it would need there would need to be it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for left or handed users . you then have grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . you just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger . and that this part here is the joystick . is this the joystick ? this would be the actual grip . probably where you'd want to have the battery as . that would be probably the bulkiest part . and you then have , at the at the bottom , the , and this would need to be articulated as . and i'd want this to rest here , at the base of the wrist . so it would fit just nicely in the hand . this part could be rotated , so it can so so so that it can be adjusted to either left or handed user . so the the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . and then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . now programming it actually thi this is one thing i've found with the replacement remote control . programming them can be pain . so the simplest way around that would be to have cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could pr program it at rather in rather more comfortable interface . and you could download programs for it from for t_v_s from all main manufacturers . though you it would be necessary to have have have ha have mode for programming it without the computer , just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet . that's that's my idea . so to gather my research , two basic methods . we compared whether people want the remote control to do lot of or they want it to look . and then we we research fashion trends in europe , what's what's the new black , , as it goes . we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look more than they want it to to be . as in they want it to do lot of good they want it to look like it does lot , and if it does do lot that's bonus , but they don't care so much , . they want it to be that's sounds bit like contradiction . technology technical technologically innovative . people want it to be that , but still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . so like the interface is really important . and easy to use , it it just so happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important the second point is twice as important as the third point . people want it is it has to be cooler than easy to use , , if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features . and if it's easy to use that's bonus . the fashion , now this is seems bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . how that relates to remote control . but see come on to that in the next in the next slide . i've als i've been saying everything's the new black . spongy's the new black as . so we have the choice between rubber and plastic . if it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , , it's spongy , then can skip the rest ? forgot to mention that . the rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber . so kinda spongy material . forgot to say that . so so my personal opinion ? we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , . but what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks , that's that's different , , that's everyone has white remote control , black remote control , you need something . like , titanium is but it's expensive . and it's bit of overkill for remote control . now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay away from it . the research did come up with fruit and veg , so it is important for it's the up to the interface guy . so if we stay away from it , stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple like that , or kiwi fruit . it could be something like , say potato peeler but i'm you have have much cooler idea than do . so is the key . few questions about spongy remote control . i've never seen one before . i've seen plastic remote controls . they were , back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had reason for it being sturdy , . for being strong and sturdy . so if we want something strong and sturdy , say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it doesn't matter , it's spongy material , it's not gonna break , . how the l_e_d_ and the lights are gonna fit into spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . so how do things fit it ? and if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , it's damage resistant and like that , so . so just to summarise , people want that's , that's that looks like it's , and if it is then that's bonus doesn't have to be people like fruit and veg . we can either go down they or stay away from it . people like spongy material . if we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . and also , this was this year . so , things change all the time , every year they they always talk about this year , this is the new black . next year something else is gonna be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type . would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining year's lead on most people anyway . you always have to bring out new designs , so if we can get next year then that's possibly good place to start anyway . seems like lot of the components could be off the shelf , so don't exactly what cost would be incurred . see your point about the number keypad , but i've would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of large number of channels . my feeling would be that even if at later date this was to be taking control of boxes as having the use of the and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be . actually if you've got lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as , becau it's if you're trying to remember what , , what number's the discovery channel or whatever . it's just irritating . that's good point . you can incorporate names into the menu . but if you but but but if you have me but if you have menu structure , then you can sub-group them . even news , music . like they do on sky digital kinda . so what it looks like to me is we'll use large number of standard components , , say something like lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most small hand held devices now . looks like we going for double curved design . what cost implications there are in that . looks like we're decided on some flexible rubber . though i'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some inner frame . would say definitely , the the idea of having it articulated there would be two points of articulation . one below and one above the the the main grip . do you think there's any way we could remove the articulation ? see why it looks appealing , but it could be weak point in the structure , do you think ? that would be worry of mine . if you're going with the fruit and veg thing , looks like banana . if you wanna design it that way . don't thi don't think that it would be structural weakness , if you have firm sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . if you then have outer skin of flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is very much organic , and would look rather co mi rather . my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice , it makes it makes it look more little bit more like vibrator than than than remote control , but . we won't add that functionality . however , one interesting point is , how serious you were there , but we if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? it's an certainly different colour from your average that's true . make it harder to lose , as . was there anything in your research . the noise for when you lose the banana , , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like monkey noise like that , rather than standard beep beep . you lose the monkey the banana , you lose the banana , you press button , and you hear like monkey screams like that to direct you towards the banana . if it that's something that could perhaps be programmable , though have monkey as default . was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . now it'd be if you had one remote control that could work with all t_v_s , you you click button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television . but why you'd need to program it like as as standard feature , . basi the for for each manufacturer will have partic will have particular command set that the t_v_ responds to . it's not simply matter of frequency . so usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you'll have all of them programmed in to the remote , and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your ma find your manufacturer and try the different codes that come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the one . that's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it . so that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . but if we had some hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing . an interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the and then they look up different names of different actual units that have been produced . or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such . is it is it actually book of names to digits , or is it like few pages ? was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping . this person probably need to use this feature like once , , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy new television , so once every , and it's . doesn't have to be used very often , . but it's but it's nuisance . and it's nuisance very close to the to to actually purchasing it , so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about . if you if there's if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it . this just to give us rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage . i'm pretty that you got that anyway . this is the conceptual one . we've come up we've covered everything we need to here . we've decided on what , , decided on standard items for most of rubber and such , so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting . so , i'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the industrial designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to , . looking from prototyping of some des description using clay . suppose you'll be told lot more about that as progress . the user interface design , they're it looks they're the idea i've pushed forward so far is more of physical one there , whereas possibly be more interested in how the l_c_d_'s going to incorporate , do you think ? or do you perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ? other than ge getting more aesthetically pleasing form for it , mo most of the layout design decisions are are made , would say . but then again , the the menu structure to to considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . so and one of the things about having an and menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it . that's very true . got product evaluation as . you see don't some of these things kinda logically follow the others . how can product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen product prototype . we'd be , no , it'd be more case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have model to test with . that's the , . so it'd be case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , putting certain number of products into the field in certain places which suppose is quite similar . or just hitting the streets and saying this is new remote control , what do you think of the look of it ? the target audience is anybody under the age of say sixty ludicrous . at this stage we still have no no target audience or . the reason i'm saying that is we're just looking at replacement remote control , something that's stylish , so you're even just you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying if they're buying it that often or they're looking to replace something then , they've got bit of free cash , so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket . and it's stylish . even single , just for the reasons of excess cash flow . although at twenty five euros , don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the device . think that's within the normal bracket . your idea of the u_s_b_ would would largely depend on the cost . u_s_b_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . that one might have to be based on the the idea was that it could connect up for allowing software interface on the p_c_ for larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such , easy minimal design , normally . programmable memory as . the u_s_b_ for which ? for the remote control . we've definitely talking some type of different . but didn't they just say it's just for t_v_ , or are we gonna , . it's just for t_v_ , but for programming it to use your t_v_ , you might hook it up to the p_c_ . i'm not , but i'm thinking that the additional cost of the u_s_b_ might be prohibitive . we unless it would make sense to . but you're gonna need some type of flash memory . something that doesn't you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , , once you turn off the power . the other thing it it would need to ha it would need to have some on board memory anyway . for one for one thing because do think that the menu system should be although , it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device , the menu system ought to be ought to be customisable and . different languages , different skins and like that . it would make sense to . how how how you want say the the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels . if it was customisable as in different languages and , that does open it is supposed to be international , ? it would make sense if you could . would say to . and we'd better be careful about the time as . we've already had the five minute warning , so . international would make sense . you're gonna look at product evaluation . i'm i'd better start writing up hell of lot of crap . you're gonna look bit more at the the physical make up you say . looks like we're gonna need prototype in clay . we'll see how that goes . are we going to be supplied with the clay is what want to know . where is the clay ? so do we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , would you say ? they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber . the fruit and veg . would that would be my my feeling . would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole fruit and veg thing . bu but but the spongy idea like . like it lot . we seem to have quite general consensus that the idea of the the rubber could be quite . having it having it br bright yellow that's quite good idea , though we could have options for colours as . this has the advantage of being harder to lose . we are trying to promote remote control , but we wanna keep the company brand as , so . so we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . possibly i'm 'm not but i'm seeing little bit of space around the joystick area which could be used . was like like said before we should have the r_r_ on the on the top function button . and that says it all really . see everybody in half hour .
that should hopefully do the trick , . about the small delay . falling little bit behind schedule . and that's fifteen twenty five . so just to try and roughly go over what we in the last one , we're gonna go how was it ? the new black , believe . something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , . many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an display . other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . so due to your hard work , we might as let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype . it's if we both step up and outline our ideas . quite how the best way to do this is , i'm not , but . now do doing the prototype gave us bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is is down here for the l_e_d_ . as it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the to left hand fairly from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just little bit for ju just thought . you could simply have slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round , so that the sticky so that the bit that sticks out bit more is on one side or the other . but as you as you see with the with holding it in the left hand , the l_ the is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated if we're going to retain ergonomic design . now got your note about keeping the cost down . we'll go into that bit more , but go on . this design could be done with with plastic casing . though would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having just rubber grip over that which would allow for slightly more bio-morphic form , and bit more ergonomic as . as for the as for the single curve , this edge and this edge , like say it would be to have some curvature to it , but it's not necessary . really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this . and you have the transmitter here and wee speaker for the for the for the fi for the remote control finder . any further comments ? it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it's gonna be flat on one side , so the will be sticking down like this , won't it ? 'cause it you can't get it curved . because of costs . and it's plastic as , so it won't be as comfortable on the hand . with the with the rubber design it could it could mould very much to the to the user's hand . one wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber , though of was to have the rubber extend beyond the end of the of the rigid substructure . so it has wee tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely . i've got if you load up my evaluation document . basic point have list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . then we will it's seven seven seven step kinda evaluation process . so not seven steps , seven scale . so after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and that will give us some type of confidence in our prototype . and the criteria based on real reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those put together from the user requirements phase . if you flip the so , those are the criteria . and perhaps could have put bit better , but you notice few things that we've abandoned , which means that the product will score very badly on some of those points . put it mildly . so we have true ? one , seven , eight , . so we have to go through each point . if we imagine it's actually straight , and just give it score . so how would you say the prototype is how have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . is the homing thing still the locator , is that still . that's still part of the design . and adam , we can keep that in ? so don't think anybody could actually stop remote being lost , 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element , but i'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have . and making it bright colour helps with the personally would have gone for purple . so we still have that noise thing , ? os on scale of one to seven , how would you rate it for finding finding it once it's lost ? i'd say number one . number number one for the first criteria . if it was just the sounder then something i've found with with say tr trying to find cordless phone or mobile , you can hear it , but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is . you can tell what room the mobile is . what about what if the the volume on the t_v_'s turned up massively and you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote . suppose you have to go to the t_v_ and do it manually . like you wouldn't hear the speaker . just before we go through all of the steps here , what we'll do is if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright . you wanna say something ? is that so is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? that's that's fine . and then we'll come back promptly to this . what do you mean cr is there anything wanna , few . is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ? something neglected from my initial research is that real reactions has goal strategy of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . that is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . so they say we put the fashion in electronics , they really mean it they they're very big on fashion , so . that's this bit here . and this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? it's just the same as saying easy to use interface , so it's kinda condensed into one . and we can come back to it , you said . no and which we will do very very shortly . slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . most of it stems from the use of the which in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because we required chip as . the only way to get this down was either to ditch the , at which point we've removed large part of how we were gonna interface , require more buttons , etcetera . or what we did was that we we as in as was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . changing it to plastic and solid unit with single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs and we're just scraping it in , we've got point two of euro left over there . so we're just managing it really . even then as , there was no criteria technically defined for joystick so i've used what 's appropriate . with any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . it blows lot of our really good ideas slightly to one side , the possibility of having u_s_b_ connection is definitely not viable now . that should still be viable . we've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the . so being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much possibility . but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here . we do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be . we can bring the excel up sheet up and show you if you wish . really think as much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some solid design , possibly meaning that the wouldn't be in this perfect place . it might be stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for handed person . suppose one thing that could be done is is have it circular and have it so that the the pink actually goes bit over the pinkie finger . it very much is about making concessions , unfortunately . do you have any data on how much different prints cost ? can you get the entire thing printed with design ? da is you mean on the plastic , or ? let's have look . you now have as much information as do . so as you can see here , , the battery really not very little choice in that one . we've gone for one of the cheaper options as . unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to . i've said single curved . we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which i've had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber's only got value of two euros per unit . problem comes here as you can see in the interface . if i've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of euro here in that it's not per push button . that might make sense , because then numeric keypad would come in at what , four point five euros , which is an awful lot , so that could be wrong . even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . as you can see , the use of an l_c_ display advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what they had in mind with joystick . why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ? that's quite significantly expensive . that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters . as you can see that's taken up over half of the price . so i'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , but because we need to shed what was four euros off of the the price of for what we really desired , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design . we don't even have speakers here . the like we what about speakers and transmitters and like that ? have we factored that in ? no , we haven't , not that'll it literally would just be button . transmitter , receiver , speakers . plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on t_v_ . is that gonna be button , or . that's too expensive isn't it ? we might have to it looks like almost nothing . good call , missed that . it's not on here , but . that's very valid point . did they do we have to use an advanced chip for the ? so if we're gonna go with the l_c_ display , then that's believe so , . what's hand dyna dynamo ? you have to wind it up ? that would probably not be in keeping with the the fashion statement and such , . so the only new thing is the on the remote now . being manipulated by the joystick , . and joystick , . which i'm defining as scroll wheel . and we couldn't replace the joystick , ? because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and , and that would be more expensive than but is scroll wheel not just back and forward ? it's just because there was no actual definition for what joystick might be , that that's what i've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation . so the is the big selling point of the remote . if we remove the l_c_ display , we could save ourselves fair amount . which you could it's shame . but that's what makes it original though , isn't it ? if we remove the the l_c_ display then there was no point to any of these meetings and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control . does this does this bear in mind that it's bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us what is it , like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components , . we should possibly have if we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to . again , you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one . but for the purposes of this meeting , i'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures . so , would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the l_c_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us , despite the cost it's gonna incur . are people not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for plastic solid case , to keep the ? one thing , ho how much extra would it be to to keep keep the the articulation ? it's hard to tell . would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , and even then i'm not quite if that's incorporating the idea of articulation . this is what i'm wondering . no , it that it needn't require it to be double curved . it can be , it can still be single curved , but you just . it's it's just it's just it's just that the case would come in would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation . single curved with articulation ? could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? 'cause like we do we have re restrictions on software ? that's what we need for the joystick though . but there has to be joystick . and the if you look if you look closer at the at the prototype here , the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight . on the on the although we've done it with curve it could just as easily be done without curves . but the curves all over hand , is it ? the curve that's really needed is up here , to put to keep the joystick in good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand . we wouldn't actually save lot by reducing it anyway , so for the purposes of this meeting we can state that single curve still allows articulation . unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal . so the product is not gonna perform so for my criteria . which is what we can get onto now . as long as so are we gonna say we have to keep an eye on the time as , but we're gonna say single curved design it could be , but at cost of , we'll definitely won't go with that one . what is sample speaker ? is that somewhat similar to what we want ? no that's that voice response thing that we got the email about . but it was just completely pointless . you got email about voice response ? did not , so . it was saying that our labs had come up with chip that you could , , say hello to , and it would say hello back in friendly female voice . we won't go with that one , did you say ? that's voice recognition , so . so , , battery definitely , it looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two euros , . so it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing . even slight , point two euros , i'd say . so we'll leave that one for now . we'll just have it's case of i'm slightly unsure . are we going for special colour ? one point five of euro for one push button doesn't sound quite . so it's case of push button is one or more . was for case . at which point if you got point five there . or had you already incorporated that ? special colour for the case . it's literally case of whether or not this is correct . i'm not quite if they're don't think they mean point five euros per button . let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it little harder to lose . so there we go . because most most remotes are fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in living room . what's the default colour ? white or black ? black's probably the normal colour you'd say , . quite like that colour that you're fetching there , it's definitely for make it glow in the dark even better . so will we go with that then ? it's not and we can see we'll come back to your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go . just to give you an idea , you want to go bit quickly as , i'm not how much time . we've not hit the five minute mark warning yet , but . t's ten minutes left . ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost . three if we're being generous , feel . we can do three . think we're being generous here with three . the special colour doesn't would make difference . it makes it stand out from it's lost in big pile of crap , it stands out from the rest of the crap . reduce the number of unused buttons . we're down to two buttons , is it ? two buttons and joystick . so that's one . where that's , that was good . i'd say we're doing there . easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus that's that's good . that's we're not doing so badly . easy to use , let's forget that one . as he models the i'd . it doesn't get much fancier . and we could do whatever we like with the l_ . let's just assume it's good display . was panicking for no reason . are we going one on ? i'd say we go two , 'cause like the fanciest would be the double curved . you'd be bit too . with the articulators . there we go . that's that's that's better too . with bells on it . more accurate numbers . we're getting rid of the locator thing which which . which is shame . i'd give it three for this for that . no need for teletext . the menus thing is something you don't normally see on on remote , but you see it in lot of other places . and what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control , so it's you say three ? might go as far as two on that . i'd give it three . i'd be tempted with three , . we'll get panned on the next one , anyway . materials that people find pleasing . sponginess is what they really would have wanted , . it is , . don't blame them . because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such . plastic , it sucks . but it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have . it's not step backwards . i'd i'd give it six , to be honest . let's give it six . that's thrown everything off balance . inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . what colour were we gonna make it ? put leopard print on it . would sa would say give give selection of colours . we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow . know , but but by this it's more case of fruit and veg , . if were buying one , i'd go for purple . leopard print would be . i'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that , that's that'd stand out . like yellow , . it would also help keep the the product placement . logo , brand . but they're referring to the fruit and veg thing . is it inspired by clothing fashion ? is this like banana type colour ? could we stretch no still , it's not shaped like banana is is that 'cause it's flat ? it's kind it probably it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , so , what , four ? that's kinda it won't be when it's been budgeted . what is what fruit or veg is flat ? this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie . or we might have to suffer badly for this one as . that's it's very ambitious , , . is that being too generous ? i'd i'd don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . is the sole criterion for being fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions . i'd i'd rate i'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually . this this what we're gonna this is their motto , like . and we're we're not doing on it . this is their strategy . imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks . might we might wanna be bit more skepible sceptical about this one . what would you think yourself ? would say it's it's not , ? in any way or shape or form . we didn't , the the yellow banana like thing is is . it's curved and we can make it yellow , and that's banana like . si it's got curve to it . is that sound reasonable ? am do you 'm stretching the the use of the banana ? i'll go with five . so we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . so five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one . which gives us an average of three . it's this would be in the middle . so we it's it's not bad . it's in the good section . it's not bad and considering the don't pick the pen . and you've knocked batteries out . it's considering the price we had to get this in , to have positive , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out i'd say possibly , based on the the cost features . 's bad design , that thing . even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven , we were to go down grade to to four , we would have to do we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic . like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract whole seven points from these things , so we're definitely on the good bit . even if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that's still only three extra points over seven . it's , we did it it was . it was good . personally , given that the product only replaces single remote control that you've already got , are people really gonna shell out twenty five euros that's only marginally good ? it depends who your who's what the target people are , like you'd say the fashion conscious women would be going , look at that , 's , it looks like it's yellow , looks like banana , it's it's gotta look good in the sitting room . it's been targeted hide it in the fruit basket . rather than the whereas more technical like like more people in with the latest technology it's good , it's got an screen 's only got two buttons and joystick . so , which which people would be more likely to buy it ? probably the people technologically . they're usually the ones that buy pointless . my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone , and she's had it for long time , . she uses it to make phone calls and that's it . so if sh if my mum saw remote control like this with only two buttons and joystick , that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , . she'd be like is this remote control , don't how do you use it , and like that . so even if it is really user friendly to us , but we're used to using menus all the time . suppose one thing is that because it's technically innovative , for someone who's technophobic , the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting . it's radical to have remote control with no no numbered buttons , . but like radical good , . how lo much longer we've got . at least five minutes . quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . so , we've got these four criteria here for satisfaction . does anybody want to do you have any opinions on any of them ? we'll work backwards suppose . the ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with . people made good use of the pen and paper ? would say i'm not quite what the advantage for us using digital pen might be . got notes and doodles . wrote nearly page , but not . this is the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the of the researchers studying this . it's all goes into their corpus . though it would have been to be able to transfer the transfer our our paper notes onto the computer ourselves . it must it does seem like the paper's still heavy consideration for taking notes . that woulda been pretty good . so this is literally just way around it . how are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ? i'd liked it , . as much as can be leadered in this thing . li , top marks . last one we've got is room for creativity . now , we got of in the end , ideas that can be used sadly . unti until until accounts came along , squish . we're burs bursting with creativity . we we're not lacking in ideas , it's that was not the problem . not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing . it's bit of pity . would have to agree on that . we needed larger budget . if you're going to aim your product at the technological sector , then you can afford to jack the price up slightly from what it is . because they will pay outrageous cash to first on the market . to retaining the the more bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in in added expense . and the price was like it was twice the assembly cost . and would it have to be twice that ? it could be like coulda had the assembly like fifteen euro . it could even that's true , . we'll still settle for twenty five . suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with at different group at . as to the costs involved . but we've got prototype . such as it is . so , it's gone today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and such . the counts wou woulda been better if we had list or more , to begin with . in the beginning , . probably would have mean we could have come up with lot more solid design in the end , would have to agree . it is very much pity to get so far into the stage and then find out that some of your ideas are just bit too expensive . always hard to tell until the costs . are the costs within budget ? they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product . we've evaluated it , and we can say that we came out with value of three . actually want one thing would say something that could perhaps be part of the product the product testing market research process would be to produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of difference the over going over-budget would make to sales . and like response from consumers . and we could even , market two versions . wee cheapie version with the bio-morphic rubber . and then the final one where you get to call it hal . but we'll go into that later . is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , anything they think that's not been covered , before quickly write up final report . we've got product . we aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be , but we've got something we think we can stick onto the the market and sell . and something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers . there is huge market . we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that . so unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such . and get my bus . for your participation . was actually upset at the budget , and that we had to cut lot of . it's like man , we we can't have the locator thing . and that's just bad . do you think the prices were were made ? that question we can ask .
here we go . i'm abigail claflin . you can call me abbie . powerpoint , that's not it . there we go . so this is our kick off meeting . and we should all get acquainted . let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? hi i'm chiara , i'm the marketing expert . would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? we'll get around to that , . we'll get round to that later . so this is just introductions . my name is chiara and i'm the marketing expert . forgot to say i'm the project manager but figured you all knew that already , so . i'm stephanie and am the user interface designer . i'm krista and i'm the industrial designer . so here's our agenda for today . we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . so our aim is to produce remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . and to do this , we have to there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . we'll get to that . there it is . functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . so throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . so we're gonna try out our white board . if we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . so you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? or just draw it ? why don't we do both . we ought to decide who starts and all that . does anyone they wanna draw ? gotta think about it for second like . does it have to be functional , trendy and user friendly ? i'll draw one . make my things here . my favourite animal is see . it's , it has fin on top too , . 's like playing pictionary . it's my dolphin . so what characteristics do you like about your animal ? like its tail . no , dolphins are really , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's , like they're graceful , and they're so they're sleek and they look intelligent and , they're it's the whole like binocular vision thing . how intelligent that one looks . he he doesn't look that smart . he's they're it's the the the interaction that or the things that the reasons people seem to like you get ex people are sitting on the beach and they're like look there's dolphins and it's kinda like but they're they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim . does anybody else wanna draw their animal ? suppose draw an animal , . uh-oh there goes the ten . they sleep all day , they're easy to draw . do you wanna anything ? if the the . had the cat as , but i've got spare one . the pen is running out of two million . so i'll use the spare one . but it's harder to draw . and the pen's dying . don't really know how the legs go , but anyway will do that . that's very good . and the main reason is they're pretty . they're very pretty and they go with the environment , and like the way they run and used to do horse riding and they're just very sturdy and animals . and like the way they feel , under under the hand , that's it . how many should we sell then ? actually haven't thought of anything yet . so i'm thinking we should design remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . what do you think , ? this is , like cat , , soft . textile tactile , tactile remote control . although i'll just put there . you're dragging you have tail . my gosh , this is disastrous . so moving on . our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro . so i'm guessing that we're not actually in scotland , we're in some european country . and we will hope to sell this internationally . can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ? selling price is twenty five euro . profit aim fifty million euro . lot , two two two million , two mi no , more four million . and it t's the profit so if profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million . it is lot . so that's fifty percent . what these mean because didn't actually make the slide-show . experience with remote control . so we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what we would like to see in convenient , practical , remote control . so do we have any initial ideas for how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have . one thing is that it should be easy to find bec bec , . was thinking that too . we should design something that has like so you can like somehow like you you always know where your t_v_ is , so just have call button , i've always wanted that , so like you can push button on your t_v_ , , so you should have call button on your television to be able to find your remote control . you have it for the portable phone , so why not . and even little light . or even vib vibrating thing . but someth because it's usually under the sofa . in which case you're going to be but if it has signal which isn't any sound if it's expensive to call is enough . don't it but like just like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and . what if it had something like just like magnet on the back of it and you could just to have some place to put it besides like base . like portable phone has base , like just to have home for it . or if it had . 'cause people just stick it on top of their t_v_ , but the point of having remote is not to have to walk over to the t_v_ , so . that's why it's always in the couch . in in the couch . it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and so we the project is now couches and remote controls . we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . but even just thing to attach it to the if you had thing , pretty object attached to the wall . but that would really make it more expensive . but it's only plastic thing , really , the thing on the wall . something like that . and the other thing is not needs to be . do you needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ? like hand hand held size , . don't think you need but definitely not . not not huge , but . it can't be that hard to put some noise on it . no , it can't be , uh-uh . no it really wouldn't be . or like or like light thing . or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you . that would be really i'm we could do that for twenty five euros pop . little homing device . so what do we think this remote control should five minutes . till the meeting . this is what we have left . also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , 'cause hate that when they have too many buttons and has to have enough functions but like , you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . button and the button , they don't do anything . you what if may be little fancy but what if it had like little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . that would be . like the way mobile phone does . it just seems like . so you could like like if you have if you have satellite if you have hundred channels , you can the way you do it on your radio is that you what do you call it but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had that's something we could decide . but , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . they would go together somehow ? because because , if it's it's expensive , if you have if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already screen , then you can pro have programming function , really easy arrow up and down , on the remote , and then use the telly as screen . but but for . i'm thinking or like you you see those people i'm thinking of like celebrity cribs things when like they have all those these things that at their house their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that and it's like hand held like turns on everything control and it has like screen and like so it should be possible to have some screen , if it must be it would probably must be ex too expensive though like . something like not it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do , is that what you mean ? but like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap . we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device . but it's something to think about , . we have to get to that later , . we'll have to see how much that would be . or some it we can find out probably on the internet how much it's . and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water what was the word ? no but it's , , spot on . good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel , something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot . that's quite annoying . just like simple thing to have clip on it , like so you can clip it to your like that's another . we should probably start wrapping up , we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . the industrial designer , what does that stand for , i_d_ , is going to be looking more into the working design . so you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and that thing . the something , what is the u_i_ ? what does it stand for again ? user interface design . user interface designer . so that's gonna be more technical . that the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it , . so technical function . the working design is the structure . what is technical functions exactl don't really it does but it don't really . you'd have to find out . it says on that email but it it said it said like be medium between you and the telly , that's marketing . it was in the email . wrote down what mine were . what effect should the thing ha should it have , . and working design . and how it works , . i'm i'm on task . and the m_e_ , what does that stand for ? it's written here , but . so we'll be working on the user requirements , . so that wraps it up . i'll see you all in thirty minutes .
so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . hope your sessions went . so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . i'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet . so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this . and start if you want . is there an order ? we haven't decided on an order . no , any any order's fine . how do put this i'll just put the cable in . just you may need to but sometimes you have to do it it's like three set setting cycle , so press it couple times , hold down function and then press eight . is that it ? can you see ? so what happens it doesn't work ? it sh it takes few seconds . is it in the thing ? you need to help me . and then press function . could you just plug it back into hers because she had . that's is that it ? here we are . the cable might be little loose . here we are . you got it . is it on ? in order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , hundred people were tested in usability laboratory through just their habits to know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . custome customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's study of the buttons that they use most and we should design according to these buttons . easy to lose , and r_s_i_ . what r_s_i_ means . the person that did the questionnaire did , don't have clue . according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , have made list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . they're used about hundred and sixty times per hour . and so and and people like to zap lot , so this is the order . channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . the other ones are the settings , and they're used less than zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that we can we could have like button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . and if we look at the market , people from from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , don't really know how to describe this , ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this product , while people that are above thirty five years ol years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five wouldn't actually pay for this thing . don't what the decision to be made is , but that the people that actually do buy remotes more are those like teenagers and young professionals and , most likely , but we should discuss this together . and that's all have to say about the matter , . shall what do do ? do give this to someone else ? just move on . so get this . so now need to press eight , what is it ? it's the little blue it's the one . function , see it . there we go . should be it should be . this my presentation about the technical functions design and just tried to focus on just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . so and like thought about it myself and looked on the internet . and so like it is really important that we get this done in user friendly and fashionable way . so things like keeping buttons together that like close together that are used in the same way , or that making the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the leas to minimum , and also things like is it is it is it can you small enough large enough i'm not we we would need to do some research about , would , about what size is appropriate and that thing , but we need to make that it turns on and off the t_v_ . does it have like capacity to change the channels ? does it do or do we need to have like functions for cable or v_c_r_ ? and then , is it findable , and how do we wanna do that ? and thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , if this will work but and we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . just like the one on the better , just because it does have fewer buttons , but we sh can think about things like like colour and size , shapes , that thing , to best fit the user . that concludes my presentation . you need the little thingy . that's on view . so this is on the working design , which is the mechanical functions of the remote , and the method used was to look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . so we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input channel or volume setting and it will be output to the t_v_ . and also we talked about location function where you could press button on the t_v_ and it would send signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , input which would probably be buttons , although we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , something to transmit it to the t_v_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly beep or vibration . and also you need sender for location signal , which would probably be separate thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their t_v_ or stick it on their wall . and this is just an overview of how the remote works . power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the t_v_ . and then for the location function , you would have sender on the t_v_ which would output some signal , we could use i_r_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . that signal would go to receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of buzzer or light lighting up . so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , button pad for input , we can purchase pre-made chip which will handle all the processing , i_r_ transmitter to communicate to the t_v_ , that's just standard , so most t_v_s have an i_r_ receiver . probably radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and i'd probably say buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . so that concludes my presentation . do about like , you seem like about . was an engineer before came here . we have we'll discuss that and then wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . teletext is outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . also our remote should be used only for television , , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable . if we have something silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had like silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . do let's we should make some brainstorming , see what we can wha what probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and the the the buttons and what it does and that thing . like in terms of how it looks , or like what it does ? how it looks or the the buzzer you mean , , for , . so is our target group then people so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? that seems to . it's easy to implement . so the , , . so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , what was it ? teenagers and young professionals . that's for speech recognition . was thinking about that but speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the t_v_ is on it's making sound and the people on the t_v_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the t_v_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , or it seems like silly , i'm not how you would implement it . that's only for speech recognition and screen . put the values in . and if if you consider our budget , it probably if you consider our budget , to have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be little pricey . but the screen is the same as what , , i'm happy with that . it's idea but you would have to have button on t_v_ or on your wall or some place since the t_v_ already has power . so are we gonna have just some like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the t_v_ itself . you click the button , it's gonna send out signal , and was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the t_v_ it's not gonna work , so probably like radio signal like on on cell phone . sends out signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . so you you'd need like separate base for that or like something you can . it would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote . so do you plug it in the t_ you plug it in t_v_ , this thing ? it'd probably just stick it on your t_v_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button . so it's now like two-part thing . so it would be two part package . so we get to design that too . make it fashionable . so do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . are we should that thing be on the thing to put the you you talking about home for it . do you still want to build little thing next to the telly or to hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? we probably leave that . one takes care of the other , like if you can if you can call it then it's . then it can live anywhere . for the so you have that button , that so there's is there light or shall we leave just have radio ? on the t_v_ or on the phone ? are we just having radio ? on the phone . it seemed like beep seemed the most reasonable to me , that's what the phone has , when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . you don't need light . and like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so . you can hear it's under the couch . so need the other buttons . so we have this . so the two remotes that you had shown don't remember who showed them , you you did , they're one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . that was that was me . they're both just like general remo they're both general remotes . 'cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities . does anyone v_c_r_s are the same across international ? they're not no . they're not , no . so you'd need like whole different set of buttons for everybody's v_c_r_s . it not v_h_s_ here ? but d_v_d_ probably is . other than that region and coding thing . and and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , it's gonna be d_v_d_ type , that's the the technology these days . let's see if still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons , like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with , or you can just scroll through the options that come up on the t_v_ . for we need the we can just design the channels ? power's just button , and it's not used that much , and it's usually that red and it's quite to keep it like red . i've seen some remotes that where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . so you don't actually have separate power button , it's just but it might be confusing . it seems like that would be hard though . like because unless . just 'cause wouldn't would probably pick it up and just be like why is there no on button . besides you like to be able to go power . never think to hold something down . have the power . so we definitely want power button and numbers . even ipod thing , like , if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have scrolling . that like joystick flat touch thing , . because people li seem now the ipod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no know you don't have one two three four five , it's just and it's one thing which has everything . that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's , it's it's funny like you like don't have an ipod but like , , like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just and it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , . and it is . it is really but do you need screen then , do you have to have screen then ? can't it tell the like can't you if you you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then it's like this like that , and then you do that . you can have the number going around in the corner . so we have this like scrolling button . that's gonna is that like on on mouse pad where like . it's like it's just like the same technology as mouse pad . i've never used one . and then you can have if you actually just want to zap , you can have like thing like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . so like it's like little part of the circle that or it so it's just region of the circle that you can zap . you can , click actually click on to have . we could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as . so volume could be like the top it and the bottom so do you need to . doesn't it rotate though , so it'll be moving around . you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like like , 'cause so , so when you scroll your thumb like around it , it'll like say you're go you're going clockwise . what do you mean the function ? that that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . but then so if you wanna switch to the to do you have to switch to function where like so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down . but it knows for some reason . it just it just kno the ipod knows . the ipod knows . if it works on an ipod then it works . so you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . don't have one . for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . and then you do that it goes , but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that i've seen . so it's like holding you can and you you is there an extra actual button ? or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down . what you for the ipod you press an if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . it's like like we can go on the fact that it does just work with the ipod . but if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , i'm pretty . if if you're gonna this for channels , , then wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ? like you could just have , like you could actually . you could click and then have it up and down , but . but the only thing is like , ipods are so expensive , like , it has to be is that part of , , . is that what makes them expensi it's all of they have so much memory though , that's it's . don't t's the wheel dealy . it's the it's their capabili they it can hold what like five thousand songs . i'm thinking we could if if we're hav so ba but an ipod just has that circle thing . and they're re-programmable aren't they ? you can put on your songs and then put on different set , that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers . like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it qui shape , like it could be , because it could be circular , , weird like that , just . could just be simple instead of being mass . because , the other thing , didn't tell you all my presentation , is that people find it find that it's big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that's another thing they complained about . what other buttons were there ? volume we've ts just said that . this is just for t_v_ , it's not for or it is does need to be compatible with . d_v_d_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , and menu . actually our our new project requirements , i'm not if they meant onl use only for television as in not for d_v_d_ or just not internet type things . so how do you switch . so i'll i'll check that and update you on the next but we'll hold off on that 'cause but . so like if we had that . but d_v_d_ players usually have their own remote . that's true , . so , 'm not really clear on what , . but it's to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch . so you'd have to have like you would have to have like function switch button , somewhere so like you can you're either on t_v_ , you're on d_v_d_ or you're on v_c_r_ , or you're like . but d_v_d_ is only like four buttons . so , but like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad . it is only fun . but the circle only does channel isn't applicable to d_v_d_ really 'cause you don't wanna but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the t_v_ so you don't have to switch . , let's think about it 'cause we need to wrap up . yes we can try that . so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . see you soon .
hi everyone , hope you had lunch . alright we're moving on to conceptual design . i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . under marketing we targeted our audience , and , . that was generally how helpful that was . then we considered some design options with how it should look , , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? would anybody like to go first ? so i've been looking at the components design . mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . and we'll need to custom desi design circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . but once we come up with design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , the ipod-style wheel . the infrared l_e_d_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . we need radio sender and receiver , those are standard . and al we also need beeper or buzzer or other noise thing for locating the remote . so we have some material options . we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . i'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have rubber case . and why not wood ? and why not wood ? can use wood . why we'd want to . and also we should note that if we want an ipod-style wheel button , it's gonna require qu slightly more expensive chip . we can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . don't t's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . so that's what i've got on design . can do next ? 'cause have to say something about the material which is quite shocking . , have been searching the current trends , , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is fashion , fancy look and feel . next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . and last thing is the easy to use factor . fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but suppose that is included in in the ease of use . our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided , noticed , that the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend and and therefore we need to go for that if we want , , wh whatever our motto is . for fashion , we go for fashion . the fashion in electronics . so we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . and also go for spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is industrial designer . as to the material should be limited to how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , how spongy can be achieved but that's the way to go . have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and prefer fruits to vegetables , but that's just personal opinion . people like to have fruit instead of vegetables in their sitting room . those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit , or should the actual remote look like fruit ? and finally again with the spongy . it has to be technologically innovative so again our industrial designer should look into that or find come up with solution that's better than mine . , to summarise these are the points that need to be , touched in order to get good decision , and hopefully our user interface has more to say about the matter . for your attention . it's the next it's the blue one , . , there we go . so that fruit and vegetables thing . actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and and so so , let me get this . t's trend in fashion , in clothing and fabrics . but you're not gonna wear your remote control . , alright anyway . here we go . conceptual user interface . trying we're gonna try to talk about , what how people are actually going to be using this ipod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . and , , , so , this is touched ba touch-based graphical interface system . so people are going to be looking at this little screen . assume , are we still on the screen idea ? we hadn't discussed it last time . 'cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the the wheel you it seems like you would need screen . you need screen for it ? you need screen with music because you're looking for specific song , like that band or whatever . but like if you think about it but if so is it just . with t_v_ channels it's , , one two three . so , you you're gonna have to switch to like d_v_d_ and like other things like that , aren't you ? we're , , we're actually not having d_v_d_ , that was one of was , to update you on that . but the screen can come up on the telly , the she said . so anyway if just we need to so if we're not gonna have screen was thinking . so it's just gonna be wheel then ? and you're just gonna you're gonna have to have some . like you're like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like mode where you can we're not choosing that , . on the you can have it on the telly though . but like choose channel control , like if you wa because people aren't gonna be able to have like , , , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . so that people seems to be . you've , you're saying , you have to but but imagine someone with but what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . but you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . so that's wh why was thinking you may need to have some screen because so that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just see like some thing where like you have like the number come up on the t_v_ like what channel you're on . you can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or ? my flatmates actually had one with wheel , and it it did show up on the t_v_ . then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to . 'cause you'll have to like but you can quickly you can . they have to wheel really fast . but the wheel goes through like hundred channels , at least on theirs . if you do , it so it would have to be you so you just kinda need to figure out like what , , range we need to have on the wheel , and so you're either you're , you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , , you can like tap for , , different , whatchamacallits , different , , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth and then there's also the concern about how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to switch around , , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that , like would too , like so and it seems it it does seem little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , , because but then again it would it does make if the screen's just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's . with that many options , you'd i'd think that the screen would be better , because you could have that menu option , . it's more expensive according to the design people . that's the only thing though . you have to get an advanced chip if you wanna have screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . so then it has to have some way to get to get to mode on the television where you're doing , you can get to , you can like it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the t_v_ and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the , . so the t_v_ is the screen , that so it would have all these different options of changing to . but the remote itself isn't really cluttered up . look it even has settings . on the you can just take theirs and just but should be comfortable . don't want the screen , but 'cause that just it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but , and then so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . what if , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the , physical attributes , , and you just have this , it's like just long silver thing , or whatever we're thinking . are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? it doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the t_v_ . so can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . like , we're looking at something that could be , like like even like cir i'm i'm seeing almost like circular like handheld like thing . it it needs to be easy to somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your how do how do i'm not really like when use an ipod , end up just using my index finger to like control it . i've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , . use it like that . or your thumb . when we had the wheely remote control , we it was on the top , if you held it like that . but , were there buttons on there as ? had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that what they do . so we just used the top part . so but it could be pretty small . like , , you you want it to be large enough that you can but can't you just get , but , , do you need that ? what if , , you had like cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? like you so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast like that ? so the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it . do do what i'm talking about though ? like , , just something , that you can flip over , , . like something on the side where you slip panel down and it's got whole bunch of . you can have it on the settings , no ? if if you can get to , if so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the t_v_ screen . that's the thing is is if if we can do this , that'd probably be , . that keeps it really . you wouldn't don't don't think you would even need it . so mean you can do it , you it's it doesn't seem that hard . so we have to look into the , , like , the programming , how this how they actually programme these things , and if that's . how they make the menu show up on the t_v_ ? it would would that would be . they already do it . believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the t_v_ , not inside the remote . i've never bought remote . it sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television , which is little my i've never bought just remote , like , so don't don't really know . they usually are . but so , but it's i've never had hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , . it always comes with the t_v_ . and don't think that should that should be too hard . it most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have button access to like change the contrast . 'cause it just doesn't come up every day . so so , do we need . we have to think about but you just need the output signal to be able to bring it up . that's what it does anyway . but also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you like , they have these abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , and never get it . you they mean , , it's like . so on the telly . so , but , you mean if we have this screen like the ipod screen ? or on the t_v_ too . on the telly , , . so , , the touch-based graphical interface is really idea because it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like now hit this , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date . and it is technologically innovative in way , so that fits with the . and it is trendy , the ipods are really hot now , so , , by web research , , so . did you did you get that pc picture on did they provide you with that picture on the web ? that's quite interesting . what are we going to do about this vegetable thing that i'm dreading ? was gonna say . you said people want spongy . one of your one of the material options is rubber that's in like those stress ball things . so , that would be spongy . , that would be . just feel , but hate spongy . that's that would be , , usually like the touch pad things are hard plastic typ mouse type , , thing . but what if we ha what if we had like spongy like stress balley kinda so you're like or what if we integrated the the the what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables we somehow made it tactilely fash , we tapped into that , so like it feels like vegetable . definitely the area round it . it could work . could be like mobiles that just you just put cover . don't 'd want it to feel like banana . if it's small thing , you instead of creating an object for it that looks like banana , which frankly i'm not particularly fond of , you could just have covers and then your mobile it's like mobile phone thing . you had there was time when they had all these different covers for mobiles . you could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits . you could name it after fruits and vegetables , or . and it could the colour can fit your sitting room , so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have green one you can have . so what if what this is i'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . so , colours . if you have like that stress ball material as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of hard plastic thing where that thing is . and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . is that 'cause i'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours . how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just the feedback we've just got about the ball ? unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables . that's in the shape of fruit , like . know , squashy ball . relaxing squashy ball . that you can see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit and i'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put sticker ? because was thinking if you have cover for the squashy bit , like , , . this is just . say that's the say that's the squashy bit . was thinking of getting cover for which is cheaper . that see was thinking this was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing . if it's cheaper actually . and like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there . like that shape . but was thinking if it was like this 'cause the way you were describing the the ipod and the thi the roll thingy it's almost like your thumb is farther up , so if if you could squish it lower then , you meant , . was thinking single ball shape . so you're holding squishy ball and then it has . it's like it has to be . so it wouldn't be very big in either like how big ? this big , and then you just do that , suppose . what if , , what if the squishy , so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can so so one you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing and you could get you could have your choice , ? just li 't des like condom thingy , like cover . but the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , and for now we can do two prototypes and then hi try and ask users what the best is , and no . it's nicer to have drawing 'cause it's neater . that's not very neat , but . and the handhe the handheld part is definitely so you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part . if it's bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your to the way you hold it . you could squish it . if it's got sand in it , , you it it just moulds to your hand . so where are the fruit and vegetables now ? fruits and veg . they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath . and the rest is the company the company colour's silver ? it was , , silver and yellow . it it looks like don't . we could promote the banana one . that's another question , where are we gonna we we should have the logo somewhere on it . should also fit the batteries , which we haven't . the batteries would have to go under the plastic case . and that would that . especially if you're switching out the squishy part . then you need to have the other part just be single unit that you can snap off . , it'd be interesting to have the the squishy bit . the part that you , , can change into the different , , trendy vegetables and fruits . you'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . then you'd get new one and you'd have to do it all over again . no but it does it automatically . does it automatically ? what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . but if someone components concept . that was me . was that you ? so what but what do we know about energy ? we're gonna use batteries ? we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and dynamo , which is something what it is . and batteries sound good . something to do with torches . dynamo is , it's bicycle . it's bicycle mechanism . it's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy . the other one was the other one was kinetic thing where you'd have to wind it yourself . so picked battery . it's quite sweet . we could have talked about doing wind-up or dynamo or solar power . but solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways . it it seems little weird for living room anyways . what does everyone else think ? the dynamo would be interesting . but dynamo the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it it creates energy on its own . what about kryptonite ? which is quite . so if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy battery 'cause they're quite find them annoying . but we need to find cost . didn't have enough data to actually all it said was it gave relative , some chips are more expensive than others , things . does anyone have costs on the on the web ? it didn't give me any actual cost . most of the is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . so don't t's that much of problem . like the chip is probably the most expensive part . what does chip on print mean ? for things like remote controls , , they stamp out chip , calculators too . so you can mass produce pretty cheap . but it's not like computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip . so , chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced . that's what we've been talking about , . case is what we were discussing . thinking of like syntactic case and thi let's see . is there anything else we need to talk about ? when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough . and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . and you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . so you'll get more instructions from your personal coach . see you soon . does it matter that end early ? how how early is it ?
welcome to the detailed design meeting . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . and looks like we've come up with some ideas . and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary . so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that . and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it . so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ? so our design looks something like this . this being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever . this is button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it it brings up the menu . and the base of the remote control , which has squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever . and it comes , change the vegetable . you could change the vegetable , or fruit . this one's broccoli . so this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . this is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . this is mango . the it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits . you don't have orange , you have mango . strawberry's not as trendy , but so we'll come up with variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . 's very bright strawberry . it's been it's been little bit difficult to make that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , , it's not too big . and then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch out . but we think that this , this size will be and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow . and the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the thing the locator . how how so so that's just so you have to have button on your on your you have to attach the button to the we have that that has yes yet to be designed . the locator is just chip that's inside there . and the beeper's also inside there too somewhere . we didn't design that . but it would be coordinating with that . that that that could match the handset . you could have broccoli , or you could have mango . if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an excel spreadsheet . the only one that's in there , production costs . and if you open it up . i've just stuck the numbers in , it was real challenge there . but if missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced ipod-like button . said uncurved or flat . that's what you have there , is that ? for the for the plastic part would be . my impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes . but it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and what that means . one side is curved and then the other side is curved . if we're talking about the area just . we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . so what else ? there's plastic for that area around the button . and then rubber would be the squishy like thing ? and lots of special colours actually . do you see anything that i've missed ? no that's alright . so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of profit . and if we sold lot of squishy things . did what did you work on ? do you wanna . i've got presentation . that's , the powerpoint one ? so need where's the cable ? what happens is we have to decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually meets the standards we were set at the start . the method is we 've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . and the findings were that we need it to look in certain way , feel in certain way , and this is everything's listed down . look in certain way , feel in certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . these are all things we looked at at the start , and criteria that have to be met . we have to use table , i'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . and we we have therefore in total we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . and the cri the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . would like to show you the table we have to use . this is the table . can you see this here ? so the que the questions i've given you could you write that down ? true is one and and false is seven . and we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . how it works exactly , haven't been told . is it possible that we can bring this up on our own is it meeting three minutes ? it's in the it's in the project documents . no it's not minutes . it's called evaluation criteria . and it's under evaluation . you've found it all ? so it was true's one . true's one and false is seven . do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ? we can do it separately and then discuss it if if that's what people wanna do . so it's actually scale . one is true and so these are the questions we're answering . yes it's if it's fancy you put one , if it's really unfancy it's seven . and one is one , . if it's somewhere in between you put four . does it feel fancy ? feels like play-dough . they shouldn't really be questions . should be more like are the batteries easy to insert ? i'm gonna say yes . very very true . imagine they're somewhere on the front . we have little case that you slip in . are we just about ready ? i'm supposed to use the whiteboard . do we is it necessary ? it's the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we our animals will forever be there . we'll just do . un unless you feel you need it to . don't feel any so one point one ? we'll just go in circle . so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? is that what the company does ? it's four if you wanna do that . it adds to sixteen , so that's four . it adds to thirteen . one five five two . she said five . one five five two is thirteen , over four for now . wasn't cheating swear . one point three is . so it's one was true and seven was false ? so you really didn't like it ? it was the other way round . it was the other way round too . so we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way gosh . sh was thinking one means no points , , all the way up to the top . it was one is true and false is seven . should've kept the table up . i'll just i'll just reverse them all . it's no problem . 'm glad this came out . was like , why did you design it that way if you hated it ? you hated it . that's quite funny . so , starting again , one point one ? one point two ? one point three ? two point one ? two point missed two . is that two point one ? put it down as one point four for some reason . one point four , one point five . that's have two of them . mine has all kinds of problems . two and one . two point two , which is one point five . why did put three ? one on mine too . three point one . is that correct on my slide ? three point one . one , four , three , three , three point two ? three point three . four point one ? four point two . two and four point three . one , two . so put one on that . i'll i'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue . or is it tedious ? no no that's we should look at the ones that like where where people said four , where it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote . i'm i'm this was so tedious for everyone . didn't know how else to do it . the worst ones were three point one . do does every ones have the slide ? three point one . the that was material . material technologically innovative , . do you want to change it ? what are the suggestions ? which one is that again ? three point one ? that it's three point one was not that good . four point one . does the shape see i'm having i'm having trouble imagining the is it gonna be the size , like the the controller ? what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? four point two ? it or bigger ? the wheel would probably be . and like then it you could hold it in your hand better . the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . they're kinda smallish . no but imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb so they could all be bananas and cucumbers . the flat one . but don't personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position . but like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat but it's still too big , in your hand . they're that stress ball they would be pretty squishable . and would it even resemble fruit that way ? like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection , like you could probably do strawberry still . the broccoli would be out . you could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , have to say , like sorta like joystick . that when you were holding that before , it actually looked . that looked really good . are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ? not that think of . these obscure fruits . that broccoli is my favourite actually . what if the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like design on the rubber . like like just printed or coloured . so it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of strawberry . that could work . or we could even have fruit like around but if we if we need . and just have the colour match . and if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be if it if it in if it conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the . 'cause no-one wants to hold remote that's uncomfortable . or like , some of you can think see as like like you could if it was only this , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . but you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable . so like that's just too big because it's sorta like joystick . see the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , which is . but is there some way we could make it this shape ? 'cause like , . we could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call the different fruits . or like even or even like like you said , like joystick like that . we went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough . like we could do i'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped . 'cause that , that fits the whole round ipod idea . and you still have the comfort of holding it like that . and you could like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and on that part . but it do we have any other ideas about that ? think the critical ones came out to be that one . we could tr . batteries easy to insert for some reason , which can be easily that's not problem any more . the batteries are going in the back ? that everyone gave that one or two . they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote . the reason ga didn't give it one gave it three because you'd have to like unc clip no you could just like any other one . no imagine there'd be hatch door , like on normal remote . so it would probably either in the no it can't be in the front 'cause the i_r_'s there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably . everyone's under three anyway . so it's those are the only two points . the broccoli wins . i'd agree with changing the shape . was just having fun making strawberries and . we were bit off task . so 't think of any so we'll have to like . you could make the touch pad in in different shapes , but then that re-designs the whole project like , but you could do like that's true . it might also annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape . and it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular . bet having different colours is lot cheaper than having different shapes too . which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit . not really 've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . so project evaluation . do you want this and we can all no . we're supposed to discuss the prod the process of the project and how satisfied , it's alright . did you feel there was lot of room for creativity in the . fruit and squishiness . how more creative can you get ? the prototype making was very creatively stimulating and we've come up with product that's fun and meets all the criteria . and how was our leadership and teamwork ? it was good . we knew what we were doing . it was very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . thought my leadership was crap personally . excuse me , am allowed to say that ? you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters . you were fine . you did good job leading . 'm never gonna do management position , know that now . we all worked very together . we didn't we it all blended quite . it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like , all had ideas about it but . no spats , that was good . and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ? like the the pens , the whiteboard , we used are you mac person ? 'm not big fan of any microsoft , powerpoint or any of this . no no never touch macs either . use the unix or the off market , wordperfect and all these other things . which isn't very user-friendly though . the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has wordperfect so have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then have to reinstall it . so have all these documents 't use now . felt like my if it was just my role , but but di that my the information that was available to me was just like or it was just the idea that we had . but there's kinda it was kinda like , don't really think what i'm doing here . so didn't really was helpful . so just made up my own and didn't really like the powerpoint presentations , so wrote lot of notes instead . but don't really like powerpoint personally , t's kinda stupid . never use it . 't say found everything particularly helpful . like it really ? it didn't really . though it was brilliant no ? my first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how remote works . no mine was really helpful as in my was quite helpful . so like so . my problem , . it depends on the role no ? it probably does . 'cause my problem was , you had access to like they'd put send you to sites and ? see couldn't do that , so didn't really you were doing . and when you were talking about it was just like that's wh that's why seemed so ignorant when when you were explaining things , 'cause . mine was mostly made up except when they told me like titanium costs more than wood to make remote control . as if you'd wanted to . but it must have been quite difficult for them to build whole whole system , 'cause they can't give you anything comparable to the internet for the , . it kinda thought that felt like would go and like try to use my information , or like i'd make this stupid little presentation and then like would end up talking about something completely unrelated because felt like was off-task all the time . it's interesting how it all went together , like had the about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and it seems planned . we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess ? if hadn't been told that fruit was they're pretty . but that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing . given certain information or just . like if everyone's given the same input don't have clue , anyway . looks like no that's not it's quite . what do you think of the pens ? it asks about that . they're kinda hard to write with though . wanna i'd like to see what what it looks like on the i'd like to . and i've forgotten once or twice to check the box . they're nicer than the pen that i'm using , because like your actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write . but even so , . and new ideas found ? it's all very new , no ? it's all very new . like it was the the microphones are when you're sitting down , but like they're kinda clumsy when you're like when you're going up to the whiteboard like . they drop off if you like move too much . but they're they're . but don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones . and that all this technology like some people must be interested in using it but 't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes , or like . the thing is , like actually worked in company , and had role and had to go to meetings . and like the last thing would have wanted would be to have to watch video 'cause missed meeting . like usually missed meetings deliberately . there's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through real meeting , like when you're actually at real meeting in real company . it's mostly like rehashing old . and you're going over general that anybody who's on task should already know . it's like the there's just really not lot of information that goes through . seems like an excessive reiteration . it seems like way overkill . like if missed meeting could probably get it summed up in like one sentence . wouldn't need to have to watch like two hour video with the sound and the transcript and i've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings . it would be it's gotta be worth it to 'cause i'm just mostly curious about like what person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause can't really imagine , dunno . does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ? any other ideas for we still have time if there's any other input . what what's the end ? are we are we supposed to you supposed to write report ? or we ending ? is that the end ? the we did really personally , which is why we've , gone through this so quickly . 'cause we've all we all our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy . end of meeting . you have to tell her , she we have to fill in all this . so that's all for today . it would be good idea , like it . it's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . especially if you have food . so we're supposed to write final reports . all of us ? there's al eight , nine . or is that just me ?
that's as far as it goes . hi good morning everybody here . and want to introduce myself , my name is shrida daseri and i'm project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . so want to introduce first of all the names and the colleagues here . and what you're drawing ? my name is agnes and i'm an user usability user interface designer . my name is ed and do accounting . how you spell your name ? do you also do marketing ? so only accounting ? accounting , yes . and i'm christine , and my role in this scenario is to be the industrial designer . but i'm not really one . so who is marketing , nobody in the market it's you , . marketing is , is me . so for coming for the meeting first of all , and we have long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about this project and the the project initiation . first of all want to ask mister ed about your marketing plan and your product plan and but do you already have like functional design or technical design or for the moment not yet , , but what's what's your do you have some project plan , something with you or . that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as marketing to to market the product . we'll have to see on through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this . for the moment not yet . no , this is like said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . we'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together . so by when you think you can give me some project plan , , discussion with by next meeting , that will be . certainly by the next meeting . so there's any questions or first of all about this project ? what is the goal of the project ? the goal of the project i'll hand out to the ed , , so to explain what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . i'm in the sales i'm supposed to explain them what to do . we have to define exactly what our product is , from from what had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that ? yes , so can you explain what exactly the product is ? if i'm not wrong , we're making the remote control . remote controls , 'cause had two different things . had first part of mine was to make remote control for new remote control for television , and afterward had discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then . so we're have to design something that is very user friendly . something visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , because everybody's experienced with remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth throwing out the window . most of them ar we're have to come up with new idea on how to make it lot easier to use , 'cause lot of times spend half day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . and what abo christine , what about your the industrial design plan ? are you have design already on this product or you're still working on the design ? no , have not begun working on the design , and actually didn't know we were designing remote control , we were designing new monitor . the website went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of some seven inch monitor , and understood that that was the project goal . so i'm glad didn't do any work ahead of time because clearly didn't understand the project goal . did see that we were starting new project together and there was going to be four member team composed of these people , and that's about that's and read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . so you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? for the industrial design ? would think that depends on how much money you give us . that's , but before we talk about the finance , , do you have some idea how we can sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and it's to the individual also . because , , you can you can make it you have different choices with different financial models . , think that in general you have to do you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's very attractive that people see and recognize its goal , and they immediately wanna have it have one of their own . so it would really would need to something like the ipod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly , so , don't care what it does , just so it looks . but when you think you can give me like design on the functional design or the technical design ? i've got lot of other projects i'm doing now and so i'll have to and see how those how those go . if they go quickly then it could be month . if if run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months . but need something in the writing , so like what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , , and what is the budget , initial budget you're looking , , and how is going to the market , , so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , , when are you going to introduce , , and by the time you introduce the product and there there would be competition , , so need some the plan in the writing from you . and it's po as soon as possible . and when would you like that ? if we have enough time then do you think two weeks is is close enough ? yes that would be good , because need to go to the management and tell them what we are going to do , and what cost is , , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because without any documentations , not go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , , that's the reason need some plan from you , initially , , then we can have the further discussion again . are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? yes , , if you need some help , so let me know . so , who are the people you need from the marketing or the technical side or the administration point of view , , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , so just let me know so coordinate all the teams . i'll get back to you on that . and ed so what's what do you think about this project for the remote control and do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or the sales strategy ? not yet other than doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into . it should be fairly large market because the number of people that the competition , agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying , like this . whether it works or not , they have to first say like this , like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use . yes , so what prefer you need to interact more with the christine , , because what she is going to do it , , and how to sell it . because she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , , so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , , tomorrow . so , what prefer , , so you need to interact with the christine more and within her team , , who is using the functional design or technical design , , and you need to come up with some plan , , how we are going to do the your sales plan , , that that's yes , that's you have to decide , , so the best thing is you both of the christine and you discuss with yourself , , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , , the commercial wise , . do we already have cost limit on this , an idea of how much we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , that's up that's up to us to decide , ? then we have to design , , how long it will take the whole project , , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . it's it's of benefit for everybody individually . so it's if we can give me some your the sales plan , , including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the team , , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , , and put it in the the proper project plan . and if you need any coordination in between compared to the the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , , depends if you want to have some marketing plan or technical plan , , so you let me know . coordinate , or , you are my coordinator , am ? between all the coor . no , not exactly . my job from what understood was to look at the usability requirements and make that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . so i'll have to interact with christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show off the bat that it's not going to work , and so it's it's loop that feeds in , but don't think necessarily that i'm in coordinating position for it . which is yes . so you need to interact with christine more , , for the user acceptability , , and the testing , , then you will yes . which will also feed into the marketing , because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users . so all three groups will need to interact quite bit . and then build the plan based on all of that , because you need to take all the factors into account . but what request , , keep ed in the loop , , in between your meeting and christine meeting , because he should 's happening . we can c_c_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around . and copy all the mails , , all the discussions to me , , so need to submit to the management . so any questions for time being ? so , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or . to come up with the functional design and to discuss with ed , , and how it's going to be work , and first of all with your user acceptance , , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , , so then we can discuss about further things . so , we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting . would you mind at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us copy of your slides ? yes , will . , that would be useful . i'll copy , le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , , share each other , , so everybody what's happening , ? and if anything you need anytime so either you can call me , or just send me email , or just come and knock my door , , so i'm available here . for coming and wish you time then . see you later .
agnes , you can help me for the slide when . hope you have fresh head and fresh time . how now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting . and we'll issue some information from all of you . and it's in the , , in the sharing folder . and will invite the christine and the ed and agnes to discuss about on the various subjects . so can you go to the next slide ? the agenda of the meeting is opening . then i'm going to talk about the project management , what i'm going to do , and , , i'm doing the project management and secretary both , , to take the minutes of the meeting . and there are three presentations . one is new project requirements . and the second one about decision on remote control functions . and finally we are closing . and the meeting time will be forty minutes , so you have to be very quick . and have come up with the management come with the new proposal , , and have to discuss few points on this . both says new insights in the aim of your project . the one is the teletext becomes outmoded , because if because of the computer systems and the new technology . so we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design . and the second one is about the remote control . should be used only for the t_v_ . that's what our management says . and the third point , it's very very important to establish our marketing or corporate image , , with this new project or new product . so will invite agnes , can you go to the third slide ? no , this is the third slide . so , i'll invite christine to discuss about the functional design . do you wanna open the i'm number two . you're participant two ? do you want the mouse , or do you want me to . i'll do the notes . so figured we should identify some user requirements , and from my experience , wanna , and from research did , the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , you can't can't have like waffling on this point , . really have it needs to be able have to be able to find it . because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . so , also , since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and ex go beyond those , and , as said in the first meeting , and then we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in in the construction , especially in the the the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and . did little history on the the remote controls and when they were invented and , so , this guy zenith created the flashmatic , which kinda like the idea , 'cause it made me think of the remote control made big flash when you turn the t_v_ on and off , that might be interesting . and so it was highly directional flash light that you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels so those are still requirements we have today , fifty years later . and it was really pioneering innovation , but it was sensitive to the sun , so that it would get would start off by the you'd get it would easily problems . so , in addition to looking at the the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where they represent examples that are available today which the one in the middle is really something to keep in mind . it'd be easy to find . and it would you'd you could throw it at things if if the t_v_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it else . and since i'm not really industrial designer , didn't really to do with this slide . but took some different schematics and put them into this , and this is what slide might look like if you were drawing circuit board . why we were asked to do this . so , personal preferences , we could i'm really thinking outside the box here , and that we should consider perhaps having an an an size remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference . so something that's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it . it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and blend in with things , so you didn't have to have problem with the the decoration of the of the user's home . it needs to be waterproof , because sometimes they fall into cups and , , it might be out by the swimming pool like that . if you mi one of one of my requirements was about needs to tell you when it's done its job or not , because half the time , keep pushing on the remote control , and if it's actually understood my message , so it should give you some an oral cue . and , course never wanna replace the battery . so , that's those are my preferences , and that's my presentation . let me interrupt you if you can add other facility , other feature , like unbreakable . because especially today , , you have the family and the kids , , and the kids throw it and they they play with their remotes and . run over it with car . so if you can add the feature , , for your fabric whatever in your outline design , with unbreakable , , that will give lot of advantage for our product , if i'm not wrong . good idea , i'll i'll yes , very good . you can add it in that . christine , and any questions or clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ? do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ? 'cause , , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder , whereas having something like , , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable . titanium would be be heavy , too , wouldn't it ? no , haven't really wanted feedback , we need to rate rank these , but we'll see what your personal preferences are and your thoughts . no , wondering whether that you had any . but who who said who said we were , , nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so it'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though . the marketing comes out . so the the i'm because the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing . let me go quickly , if go back . know the project plan and the budget . so close this , not . was in this . so let me see where is this file . this is christine . and that's mine , . that's yours , . verbally we can we can sell . will will send you mail , ? the project may be the the project aim , . at the end of the day , the company wants to make at least the fifty million euro . and the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side . that eddie will talk to you about how much the price and what's how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be we sell in the market . then you can come back with your feedback . and have one the suggestion or opinion . this remote control , , it can be for like universal , to use for any t_v_ . and it will be slim , , and not fat . not fat , . might be hard to find , though . but let's try it , , with the different the designs , , the functional designs . so any other questions ? from her side , don't think there's too many more questions . if you can come to the , from the marketing , from the marketing side , just to to give an idea what the management is looking for , was looking for remote control to have have sales price of twenty-five euro , with production price of twelve and half euro . christine for time being , so then ed , so can you tell about . 'scuse me for one sec . for what from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , don't think that price is exactly in the market . i'll explain myself here now in the sense that in in the recent surveys , from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money as fancy as trendy . twenty-five euros , that's that's preson reasonable price . that's market price now . now if we're gonna take risk , and push this up bit , make it more expensive , but give them added things that they don't have now , then it it could possibly sell . the risk is there . too expensive , they're not gonna buy . but , there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested . and we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on remote . we can't make remote into computer , but simple commands . louder , softer , on , off . that might be possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this . thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use . so we have to figure out way of making it more user friendly . fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time . so one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's beep beep beep , and they can find it through , , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home . but , in the cost that the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible . but if it's trendy , if it's fancy , it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy easy to use , if it's got simple remote speech remote control , like said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , find my my remote without spending half day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause 't turn the t_v_ on . so we're gonna have to look at it in in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial design . but , price we have to talk about . so what do you think about the design ? do you think you can make it or what do you think about the design , what he was talking about of the speech recognition ? training is always an issue with commands . so might we can perhaps do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , it could reduce the overall cost . but anyway , also that this might impact the battery life . and so , what we'll have to do is add something where you can recharge it wirelessly so that sen send power to it . so or set it out in the sun and it , , gets , from the light , solar cell inside there so that you have enough juice to do all these fancy things . it seems also like with the speech recognition , , it's feature , but if you're watching t_v_ , there's lot of ambient sound , and it's words . it's not just , , noises like something hitting . it's actual speech , so then you have to make that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the t_v_ speech , and the the user's speech . otherwise , you can say remote . but if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of sudden , you have someone in movie saying off and your screen dies , because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your t_v_ . so , if we can find speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems , then , it'd be really good marketing gimmick . but , we need to consider how that would impact the situation . very good point . because tha with speech recognition i'm not that good at that idea but if it's one-word recognition , 'cause know with telephones and cars and things i've seen in the states , friend of mine says call mom , and it calls up mom . the radio can be on and everything . because with speech recognition , if the the remote or like the telephone it has exact word that it has to hear . don't would come through sentence in television . if somebody's speaking on the se the television , they're not gonna stop and say remote , . so that something could be designed to recognise single word like the like the telephone . no , it's idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements . no because this is this is years ago in the united states where we're driving down and he said call home , and the telephone called immediately so , that's kinda cute . what suggest to you , christine , , if you need some the technical feedback , or some training , , about this facility , especially for the speech recognition , recommend you some companies like intel or i_b_m_ , , because they're already in this speech recognition part , . and you can have some technical backup from them , some technical tie-up . and if you want , coordinate , , to get some information , , and you can let me know , , so what the details you require , to add this feature in this project . don't t's the difficult . and we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from what today . we'll find that out . from from your side , you're gonna have to go back the management and be more precise . what do they want ? risk , take risk on the market ? something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily make boom in the market ? because it has to be something different , has to be total new . something that nobody has now . but but end of the day , you're the sales guy , so will come back and sit on your head because you are going to give your sales projection , . and it's gonna cost . it's it's good to tell the management how much it's cost us and how much you are going to benefit , . and , so don't mind to convince , , the management to spend some more money on the project , , if you can make out of the money from this project . if the bottom line is positive . yes , don't mind to convince the the management , . the management says , , so they they don't want certain facilities , which it's already worked , , they want something new , . like speech recognit definitely they will agree , don't think they'll say no for that , . and hope convince the management on that , . so if you have any new ideas , , for your you can always come up and you can tell me if you need any special , , coordination , , between any technical companies , which you can hide their technology backup , , for your functional design or technical design , , then am ready to do that . and what's your comments about , so you are finish , ed , so , i'll hand over to agnes . , if go through my presentation , you can see what the user perspective is , and how it ties into the other two comments . just gonna close this . where are you , here ? nope , here good . and that's fine . so , , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . so , in our case , existing remote controls . and then , what the good ideas are , and what the bad ideas are , and why they're bad and good , which isn't always as obvious . we seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case . then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that'll feed into both ed's work and christine's work . and then what the remote control should look like , , once we've got good idea of what the functionalities are . so , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you need to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off . you need to change channels , both by directly going to specific channel or by channel surfing . you need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the t_v_ to regulate contrast or whatever . so , the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do . often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's functionality that you don't use very often . and that the buttons are too small . so , here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . the buttons , in lot of cases , are tiny . they're hard to see , and , they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . whereas , on the other side , you have much simpler remote control that has the minimum functionalities that are needed . and it looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . so , would be inclined to go towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . and if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing buttons . so my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to limit , or to minimum , , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design sleek and simple . which , ties into what christine and ed have both said fairly reasonably . so , that's it , an if you have any questions or . it's , seems very understandable . clearly your research and and ours heading in the same direction , and the only thing that saw missing from your your research that we found was this ability to find the doggone thing when you need it . yes , that's true . so , , but that's . that's why we're all here at the table , so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and we it's complementary . also think that the the feel of it is , when you hold it , is something that was expressed more in in in in my design and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an industrial designer's more thinking about , the look and the feel , and , you're first . that's definitely very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in lot of cases , . so don't have any questions . so for anybody need any help , for time being , on this subjects , , so come back to me , and christine , try to help you to get some the technical the companies to help you for make design slim , , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all . should we make decision about what features we actually want to include , 'cause we've thrown lot of features onto the table , but do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ? do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide , that would provide some guidance ? doesn't really tell us . so not really this one we are talk ab . says individual actions , it says user interf so i'm supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept , and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach . we should do as many features as start with all of them now and eliminate them later in the process , that's my suggestion . no , i'm just thinking in terms of time , like if yes , now i'm objecting . that will be . and i'll send you the the minutes of meet . you can object if you want to we should take that as an action item for after the meeting , 'cause our meeting time has run out . no , , was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ? it takes lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , and if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , it's better to spend it on the thinking more about features that we actually do want , but . we we still have . somebody else has go to use this room , and , , we can't hang out here and talk about this , so very much . what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break , , then we can discuss furthermore , , with our areas , and then we will come back again in the in the next meeting . so for coming and i'll send you minutes of meeting , and put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information . so let's go for lunch then .
welcome back after lunch , hope you had good lunch together . for this meeting the main agenda to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . and the agenda will be the opening and that's the product manager or secretary that's me and the presentations from the christine and agnes and from mister ed . and finally in this meeting we have to decide and we are to take decision on the remote control concept and the functional design so we have forty minutes , it's little bit low , but hope we can finish it up so i'll handle to the the functional team , to the christine , , to discuss about the components concept . so , if you could open the powerpoint presentation . i'm number two . you're number two . the next one . components design , there we go . so can we put it in slide show mode ? here , is that little that one , yes . i'll take the mouse . so we were looking he specifically at the components the following components , the case , the power supply , the means of communications with the television set . in instance we had talked about using some speech recognition , you have to have microphone no you don't actually haven't have to have microphone in the device , but you do have it way it has to it has to hear the speaker and , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , and way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . so the other thing that we so . our method for going about this is we've looked at the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so this is the approach that we took during our our research . so for the case , we told we were making specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . course , , wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but that doesn't seem to be one of the choic non-option we can we can really explore , so then we were thinking about rubber , but unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat factor and there might be some problems with the how it's goes with the board . and then plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after while , so we still had titanium and and wood available , but unfortunately titanium's also been eliminated , the people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make curved cases out of titanium , although how apple did it with powerbook i'm not su quite but nevertheless they've eliminated all of our options except wood . so , this is our finding . at least it's environmentally friendly . and as she said , it's an environmentally friendly material , so we're we're currently proposing , we'll get to all my personal preferences in just second . so then there's this other matter of the chips and could use simple design on the board , but these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much intelligence with this simple one . and then there was the regular which regret that i've forgotten exactly why i'm eliminating that one . the other option was this advanced chip on print , and we liked we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , which 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the chip . and manufacturing has told us that they've recently developed sensor and speaker that would be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so we we now jumping to our personal preferences i'd really think we should , , use some of some really exotic woods , like , , you come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some woods . that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do this three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit custom car order , , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then think we should go with the solar cells as as the microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . so this is the findings of our research and my recommendations for the new remote control would be to have have it be made out of wood . do you have any problems with that ? can you go back one slide ? i'm not , how do , know , let's see . let's go back up here . yes , question , , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? what's the meaning of that ? it's multiple chip design and it's printed on to the circuit board . could find out more about that before the next fi next meeting . is it means it's on the is it on micro-proc micro-processor based or , tha that would be , so if you find out from the technology background , , so that would be good . but i'll find out more at our next meeting . why was the plastic eliminated as possible material ? because it gets brittle , cracks we want we expect these these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . good ex good expression . whic which although with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you , it chips , it if you drop it , it's i'm not su if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , but you can't just use , exactly , . speak for yourself , i'm planning to be around for while . so so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes . actually , i'm ready to sell it . i'm ready to sell it . no no no no , the the only the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , but there are some very pretty woods out there . and you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . 'm glad you , good . that's actually very innovative idea . sorr having hard time keeping wi control over my face . it's actually very innovative different idea that you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . it's each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market . so it it's looks good the the design the functional design , what about yo you ? in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own . yes , in yes , in term in terms of comments first then , , let's move to agnes . in turns of . she works in the cubicle next to me so she's she was already little bit prepared for this . luckily ed was not . we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation . one thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having , . you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your it's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . so , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , but . they do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , so , and chew up . they do it with other materials as , . and chew up . you're you are in participant three . one point three , . that's the one . so , it's very short presentation , 'cause i'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , , which shows , took the ideas that we were talking about last time and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which completely agree with christine's idea to have it molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the standard very straight remote controls . and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have wider remote control . my hand is different size than yours . so , that's actually really good idea for customi customisability . one thing might be interesting is to put flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch t_v_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . and also you had issues with the batteries running out , so we could put little battery life-light on it that goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . and in terms of invisible features , audio and tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . so , in terms of what this thing would actually look like despite working in interface design , i'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . you'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your t_v_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . and then you have one of those toggle displays for , , channels and volume , for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to . and then here you'd have your standard , telephonish number pad . and then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your t_v_ and on the other side way to turn off the voice control . so that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . so again you can have little light somewhere , the flip thing and have forgotten anything ? so , as you can see , it's very very simple design , which is one of the things really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . think the design can carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . be like copper hinge or . but you also have to start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . but that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . as you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly large , depending on personal preferences . so , that's all had to say , , everything else in terms of design issues . the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , the number pad little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently . so once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less it should go along those lines . so what's your , , the comments or . it's what consumers want . it's almost like , houston , we have product here . problem is gonna be cost . also have very simple presentation , because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want . also have copied different type of remote . if you can find me , where i'm at . there should only be one in here . it's being modified . they're stealing our product . we've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause trends change very very quickly . in six months this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be question how fast we can act . they already erased the rest of mine , . no , go to findings . no , no . no no , no no . 'cause had another comment there . the market trend . this is what we know from the last from the questionnaires from the the all the surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , we have to have something completely different . easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that , with the whiteboard we can see that it's remote that's easy to use . and this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . so even if we have product that may be more expensive , if it comes out , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . the second two , you can see the last one is very easy simple design . the second one , there is about forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , very hard to use . the first one , see that they put in display . now there's something else with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , but with the little flip-up , if you have little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , if you see display because i've seen mostly the standard ones , . context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ else is in . especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and . now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . the idea is simple , but with display , so you can see what you're doing . so if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , with display , wood , designer wood , designer colours , we might've . what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like some foam rubber ball , and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand . so it's really molded to to your specific but for that you'd also have to do an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . to an and then you would know like what the geometry of their hands would be and yes you'd wood to get . how hard they squeeze ? resistance resistance , . , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . that that actually would increase the the revenues we could expect , . the sales , . no , but incorporating the three it'd be something new on the market , different and from although , what it was it it was nokia that came out with this changeable colours . already the customisability is really good new gimmick . you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions , millions . and that took off , , . so say with the with the findings , with the research , easy to use something new . we have to come up with something new that is not on the market . we'd also have to wor consider that who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna learn about labour laws . in different countries and wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit labour in third world countries . so actually you could turn it turn around and say that you're par the reason the cost is high for the device is because you're paying working wage to the person who made the device . but we can get production in , , countries like , , india yes , yes , countries like india or china or malaysia , so you can go better features and better price and you can sell more . cost of living is low . so , , so yes . good , that'd be something that manufacturing would have to explore more and to where . where where it would be manufactured is is another step . so , so yes , but that that we can that we can talk about the production later , , depends on the the quantity , . we're here to design , come up with product . so we don't need to have our own fabric factory , so we can have tie-up with who the do the fabric , , for the different electronics items , then we can have business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , , to sell more . so , but le let's decide first about the components concept and interface concept , , if is acceptable for both of you , what ed was talking . and your design whether you want with the display or without display or just simple , so . it depends , it's good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the t_v_ you already have big display in front of you . so , if we're trying to keep costs down , then sacrificing the display is way to go . it depends on how much putting display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for , 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in big display case or big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , but that's just speculation , . what do you think ed ? do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , , do how much it costs , , to to add little display like this ? no no spec it's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? no that's no problem . i'm here for the pushing it after it's made . will market it . once we get price on it then we can market it . so the the advanced chip on print is what what we've we've deci we've determined and the engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and we've kinda come to some agreement regarding this concept of wooden case . customisable and don't , no , they could be rubber like they are now , so you have that tactile experience of so are we done with this meeting ? beautiful mahogany red wooden case . what about the buttons , would would the buttons be wood too , or . so what we'll do is , , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . so what you can do is , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , , the model . hope , if is it if they will come up with the prototype design , . then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can submit to the will submit to the management . then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for the display . and marketing strategy . an and the marketing strategy , that's very important , . and marketing strategy , . how much you can how mu how much how much you can sell extra . you'll make money too , so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission . so , any questions ? so , by next meeting , so , come up with the the prototype , , then , then we can proceed from there . so for all your efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then .
i'm to be late . welcome back everybody . so this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting . and opening and p_m_s of the meet minutes , prototype presentation from christine and agnes . agnes , yes . yes and evaluation criteria . the finance , it's from my side , from the management , and production evaluation . so we have forty minutes to discuss and finalise and close the product and project and to move further , , so , let's talk about first for the prototype . so handle to so shall go to . i've done presentation , but it covers work that we've both done , so if i'm missing anything , christine can just correct me . so you did powerpoint presentation , good for you . let's go to a_m_i_ . it's not the biggest powerpoint presentation in the world , but three . so in two or three or . no it's t's the last one . technical pa would think . no , then this is the la , that one , final design . it is named appropriately , you just couldn't see the name . can have the mouse ? alright , so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , then you just take it off . so to unveil our lovely product . this is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see . so if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow display . this is actually hard to do . the yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . you have the the red triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . so up volume up , down volume down . the green are the channel changing . and it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . and then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the t_v_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . so this is what we had on the white board the last time . and could the we haven't specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . so that you can really make this highly highly customisable remote control . that depends on the design of the circuit board inside and what room is left yes , . the microphone is on on the top , on the middle , the under the flip . so that will be the safe , so any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to yes . no , it depends on the design of the circuit board . but it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . it's it's , but my opinion it's better under the flip because whenever you want to the talk , , so then you can speak then you can close it . but if you put it on the on the flip , , then technical don't t's feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . but if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and i'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , just use my voice . i've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and i'm holding my cup of coca-cola in the other hand . and you don't wanna let go of either one . don't wanna say . it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere . can also be on the side . the sides is good . so that's good idea . so , pass this around if anyone wants to . so it's good idea . better you pass it around with napkin . no , because you can easily put microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice . so it's good idea . it's it's you need to work on the weight little bit . compliments to the artist . i'm fine , i'm satisfi i'm satisfied . and the shape of the buttons , the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but . we're glad you're satisfied . it's it's it's looks more heo heavy , but when it's completely it's less weight . this is plasticene . there's only so much you can do . we could have possibly made it lot thinner as . but and part of the thing is lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . so this is excessively heavy , but it needs to have some weight , it needs to feel like you're still holding something . so that's it for our presentation actually . that's your prototype model ? that's good , very much . so any comments or . the prototype is is very within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings . now it goes into this next phase as the financial marketing haven't come to mine yet , so we're gonna have bit of difference of opinion , yes . yes , that so i'll come back to the so evaluation criteria , that will be good , so then let's come to the finance , have some calculations which made as for the budget . so here you can look like the energy and dynamo and kinetic and solar cells . it's optional , somewhat optional and ed wants the chip on print , that's what we were talking about that . so then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then we have the wood material , then special colour and push button . so it's actually , our budget was twelve point five euro , but it's coming to nine point nine five euro , so we are under below the budget , , so still we are saving some money . it's good figure . yes , i'm surprised . it's gonna cost long way to , cost lot of money to market it , is it ? so it's for some money we can utilise for our marketing , for the sales , , and it's not . it just depends on if we're gonna add on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have l_c_ display . l_c_ display is gonna be very expensive , it's gonna be it's not it doesn't say . no we do , but it's not filled in . it's number thirty . we don't have the price up there , , so if we add approximately two to three euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and half as to what the company had initially requested . , , you're , , yes . so that means we can put the the in , . but as far as production i'm putting up question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see the problem with our survey , the the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration . this is just production cost , it is not advertising cost , it's not transportation cost and that will inflate quite bit the cost of the the cost of the unit for the company . yes , so still we have twelve point five euro . so to come up with what the company wants is fifty million pound profit , we're gonna have to go long ways . this we are talking about one unit , , so when it go into the quantity , , and the cost will come down . although customisation , because this is being done , , the on on-order basis , it might be the the quantity won't won't the circuit board will you're , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would be fixed at the you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one euro . it's gonna be very hard to reduce . that's not bad . that's really that's the cost of the material and lab , that's really outstanding . but anyhow , still we are under control , , so what will do is will try to negotiate with the vendors , , to get the production cost less , , so then we can save some money , , to put into our marketing or the promotions , whatever , , so that will look after . will speak to the management and how to get some more cost down . if we can go to to my display . and we'll come back to yours just to give everybody an idea of the market . so now i'm gonna scare everybody out of this project . if i'm still here . you're in four ? the four gives me it's gotta be trendwatch . is this the same one you did before ? it shouldn't be if it's not it's not the one . that's no , it's the same one . no , no we no , that's the same one . you have to go back and find another one . whatever name it popped up under . functional , try functional , it might not be it either , but we'll see . it looks like it , there's . so we'll go screen by screen . although since we need to have some type of idea on market we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study . so if we continue , we'll look at the findings . which means that if we have target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , which is actually tremendous amount . no kidding , . mayb they already expected something . so , if we put an inflated price of fifty euro at production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five euro , , we're already in that that price , , with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers . twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . at two million units , we have to have profit of twenty-five euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit eu euro profit . so , we did run down the evaluation of the form , the fan the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . so , now we have to come up with decision . can the company sell two million units ? can it sell it for fifty euros ? could could go to findings ? would like to explore the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channel which would be to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the product to the customer's residence . was thinking the same thing , . that way you have no storage , you have no you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , but you don't have the transport to the point of sale . the point of sale is online . to the agents . you can do shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs . we should sell through amazon , don't you think ? or ebay , or yes . or ebay , . there's an idea . going with , we we're do , selling unique product . that's good idea . to impro more profit and , yes . that actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , whereas if you're in store , you can't unless you're highly imaginative person , you may not really it is you want , whereas on the web , if you have bunch of pictures , it can trigger ideas and . there are several companies that have gone that way . and you can even have an movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight . the weight and feel . weight , the feel of the product , but there are several that have gone through with the watches , too . we're getting used to that . it's not quite like trying on shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying . you can customise watch , you can see how it is at the at the end of the production , you can change it there's lot of online that's that is doing this now . and when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way it's possible to do with this , there's possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could , feasibili feasibility lower the price of the unit . don't think that's not possible , it's then , let's for the production , , then you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and how it look like the real . what turnaround time do we have ? but yes it's it's very quick , . 'cause production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long . it will come back in two weeks , , it will be ready in two weeks . works for me . for evaluation , . prototypes , you mean . yes , the prototype prototype product evaluation . in we probably should do some market tests once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it . that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , to see get get their we covered everything . so you can take minimum two weeks to maximum four weeks . think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use it's not trivial task . because we we are not going to do it in our factory , , so we can give it product evalua yes , yes . we definitely shouldn't do it in our factory . so we'll do it in the other place , and don't t's take more than four weeks time . or , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , , then it's approve from the technical team and your team , , from the management , then we can launch in the market . any any other questions or comments to be discuss ? no , i'm go ahead . what ab was just wondering about if we're gonna do product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . so then , let's take like this . did you have something ? let's proceed with this model , , for the for the marketing direction , . so no more changes will be made , , in this the basic design . so we will introduce this model and let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can go for the second generation . there's no end , there's not limit . the problem is there might not be second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . every every custom . then it may not be . every customer , , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , , so there's no end , there's no limit . like people don't like wood . no , but there's difference between releasing product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit general range of requirements versus releasing product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . so that's the reason you are here for the design , , hope you made good design . yes , but i'm not everybody . the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . we have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell . but see , we ought to take few considerations , , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , , like you can eat you can all eat more chi eat more chilli , , so it's depends on the individual taste , , so we have we have to balance somewhere . i'm just trying to point out that that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and . our project doesn't ed , do what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for t_v_ remote control sales ? would it be the christmas season by any chance ? the sports time . before the eur the world cup . which sport season ? so so what so what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of user-tested device with some special event . world cup soccer , they need those things that they have their hands occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control . that's good idea . and and then so that gives us little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because when the world cup is , but i'm there's gonna be one . or any major sports . or another major sports event . probably not the the football games coming up the end of january . that might be little too aggressive , but , so , i'm just ig pointing out strategy to do some additional user testing pri and then to launch at major sports event or perhaps to also and to work with motion pictures . that's actually good place to advertise it too . there might be some motion pictures that are coming out that are coming out on d_v_d_ that they need to have special remote control to work with it , so we could work out campaign with with sony pictures . some management has got relationships there we can leverage . yes , the that will convince the management to do that , . it's just something to to keep in mind , 'cause it's really really important . lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when it gets re-released few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy . disposable diapers is an example of that . yes , it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was disposable consumer product , and people the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it wasn't but then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design , but people had gotten the throw-away , , paper cups and napki all kinds of things that they hadn't so , you're , timing is very important , but we've got good product . that didn't know . that's the reason ed is here . he can promote the the brand value and the product value . it's gonna be very important to the company . we are behind the scene and he is the front screen , so . i'm the one who takes the heat . he's on the big screen . good luck , ed . if it's flop , it's the marketer . you look very relaxed , considering , the the weight on your shoulders , . so then let's come to the closing and are the costs within the budget and is the product evaluated , , so that will come soon . for but our time being , so for all your efforts and work and design and let's leave it to the ed for later for once production is over and the meantime let's celebrate . so let's meet up this evening to hang up for some party . working with you . again for all . and see you in the evening for drinks . , see you later on .
you have to put it exactly on the on the . took your mouse . should bring my pen too ? just , no , that's for me , have to make some notes . got my mouse . also forgot my mouse , but don't need my mouse , . there we are . my laptop is crashing . cr help help help . let's just check one more time . can you hear me ? actually my laptop doesn't work , switch it on again . yes , it's working . so you all read what we are going to do or not ? we're gonna make remote control . my laptop is bit etchy . made simple presentation . so you put some things in it . how does this work ? one most to the . yes that one . so that's my name , . we're going to make remote control , you already know that . just have look , are we going to this agenda of our meeting . this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . so the thing we have to you already we're going to do , you also read what this the things or , not yet , . so , , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that's what we're going to design . first we have three steps of making the the remote control . fir the first thing is the functional design , that's very important . we have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the next meeting . the the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it that's the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . and we have to look what the market is doing for what remote controls are in the market . and the third thing is the detailed design and that's exa , what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . so no , this is these are two smartboards , with the an introduction of that one . and you already saw all that that you here can put things in the the red project map . folder , yes . so no have look at that one . so what we're going to do first is so you can read . you have to draw favourite animal on the whiteboard and and say why it's your favourite animal . so and you have this is just to try it out and we have to use different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . so , so first have to show you , you can come here to have look how it works . see it now . this new page , it's . use pen format . and different colour can use here no take the pink . you take there's no pink , , just purple , . and line width ten . just take what i'm going to draw is an elephant . just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work . it's very elephant , you can see . what it looks but it doesn't matter . something like this ? it look like dinosaurs . just takes so long , . whatever , just . you erased this one . it's bit slow you can see , this is bit annoying . so just for you just one of you can draw painting if you want . let me try one . just don't , just use it like that , . and then what's the colour ? how do do . it's in format . i'll take this one . there has to be water , but , but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water . just no it has to be an animal , so if that's it's it should be shna snake . the water is important . so first draw the water . and now make the animal . this is worm . do you have to write down why that doesn't matter , just it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's . just make new blank new blank page . not too far to the to the pen top . let's make it dog . you should hold your pen bit more to the back , so that no , to the . no , it's dog . make cat of it . we only have twenty five minutes , so . take it easy . was gonna make cat too . use your fantasy . not too quick . just hold it more more to the back then you don't have . no have it . draw too quick . no , that's , . it's just to get used to it . these pens would be just you write it down and you download it to word , you already did it or no ? no , not yet , . , it but you actually got to write on the paper . but it's just ? you really got to write on that paper . know , but it would be just in in in typed words in word , so that's not just it's just picture . it's real pen . but it's just picture . so it's not that as thought it would be . you really no . you can you can't edit in the edit it in word . what time did we start this meeting , i'm not . half past ten . now we just have to save everything , so . this is definitely the best one . so what we that we have to sell this remote control for about twenty five euros . and we have to make profit of fifty million euros , so we have to use big market in europe . piece of cake . the production cost are about half the price of selling price , . so can someone make calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , . so we're gonna have little discussion about what experience are with remote control the and everything , so just have look how it we think about remote controls . my first question was does it have to be universal remote control ? that's good question . because we sell it lonely from the and not with the television , we sell it apart . it's i'm not i'm not , it's not don't think you can buy universal remote control for twenty five euros , so not , but , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . so because , know you can buy re universal control for only twenty euros , . it probably would be universal . and only television ? or more devices ? and also for the v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ player and . everything just so lot of buttons on the remote control . not just t_v_ . no , just everything . so , what what what's remote control , it's just black thing with some buttons on it , it's not nothing very special , but , . can try to make it special . so do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user . about making it the same style as the television , we don't have the same television all the time , so that's no matter . if we control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player player with it it has to be clear , because kids and elderly are gonna use it , so it's not only for the technical persons . it must be very good control , so you can act use it from everywhere in your room , the the infrared thing must be from very good quality . should be good point . nothing it shouldn't be too big , but don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have lot of functions , so . and how big should it be ? yes that's that's . we can't make it smaller than the things we see now . just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it . or we have to make something like mobile phones that you can fold it opem . then you can make it smaller and uniquer , more trendy . but you you you you think about one you can fold open . fold open , where you can see more options . something on top , just dren general things like volume and t_v_ channels and inside things you don't use that often . or you or you could think of an small touch screen on the remote control . for the d_v_d_ pla player , if you just . that's good , . wanted no you can make an manual in it . why should you use touchscreen on remote control ? be it's it's , or to keep it easy and small . there are buttons on it . but but it's not reachable , touch screen . but it's not too expensive to put touchscreen on it . but that's , it's much too expensive . like to have , it would . and we have to care for the strength of the remote control , because remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often broken . and if you have touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile fragile . and lots lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not kids ma home station . you can put games on your remote control . and how about the batteries ? should you put it in recharger or just . that's good idea , just to put it on your television and just recharge , you never have to use any batteries . that's good idea , but , we have to look at the price now . how how mu how how expensive is normal recharger ? how much is your standards mobile phone recharger ? if you buy it separately from your phone it's probably expensive , but what the project projection costs are for such thing . have , 'cause . if you look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because it's too expensive . but home station is really good idea , because lots of people are lose their remote control and where it is , and now you can put it always at the same place . it's therefore it's good idea , but it's expensive . use it as separate option . sell it separately . you can , you can buy it with it . but have mouse that's also , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , or you can change your batteries , so . the option , just the option , that's . set something on paper already , size , looks , usable , the buttons on usable places , the the on off button must be on top , it has to lay good in the hand , you you have to , don't if we you can make it very special , to create our own looks , but it's very hard to nah . has it be has does it has to have to be like different form than normal remote control or . we have to look at that , 'cause you can do the standard way , but then you won't you can have the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the t_v_ channels one two three four as block , and then the volume on on top , so you can see . if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do lot of testing , if it really works . but the rest is you don't use that often , so if you have clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as . so it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control , so you can do something unique with that . and what we have to think about too is buttons that you use often are like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you can still do the the functions . what paul already said . on on top are the the basic options on top , and if you fold it open . just for the t_v_ and just the normal function , that's fine . but , but when i'm watching t_v_ i'm just using like five buttons or so , so . but it's it's very hard to to make it fold open and to look like it's very what's it's called ? if you if if you make to fold open it's or also an the strength is not as good as normal remote control . it's hard no , . so we have to to keep it like square , just normal remote control . just think about it . we have to close this to finish this meeting , so . there's some more things . we have another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . so what you have to what you have to do ? for for me the marketing expert , the user requirements specification , do need to think as user , as only the looks and the . no , what you want to do with it . this if you you have to it's for t_v_ , d_v_d_ player , all that things . also from user , but all these things together . it's also about strength and for everything . also wrote down some that you want on technical fun fu what do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control . no not not , that's not that's something for for for . that's not for you . just if what's in the market , what's normal , what buttons do you have . already wrote some down , some ideas . just is that ? there's already document in the folder about it . so see you in thirty minutes . for the next time you have to put it exactly on the square , so your laptop . it didn't say that .
forgot their name , so you're , forgot them all . so have to write it down . so do them or . for for for my sur jens . no , but your your surname . and what's your name ? what's your name ? but your surname . was little short on time , but what ? me too , so that's not no no no , fi first my so let's have look , we have forty minutes , so it's it's more than enough . which one was mine ? so we have no , what's that ? so so we have forty minutes for this for this second meeting , and we have to make that we going that we are , that we are , that we we're going to make what the product is going to like look like . first have the notes of the last meeting , so showed show them to you . about that , escape this one . how do escape this ? how do escape this presentation ? and show , . so let's have look at this one . so the the the points we had last meeting was the should be univ universal remote control no , that's got email from the from the personal coach and it should be t_v_ remote control only . so have you changed that part ? so , it still has to be remote control for kids and elderly . it's it's still the same . all these points we have to look at . you all know them . but there's another point . the the main people of interest of this company are forty plus people . so they're old and not younger people . so we have to look at that as . 'specially old people , bi bigger buttons , . so so , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for it doesn't matter , just start with the didn't read read it , so it's not for me , didn't get it anyway . which one first ? functional requirements , . my name is jens damman , but we're in group , and will start it . i've used marketing report on the site . you've read it too . and and furthermore surfed the the other site . you didn't read it ? no , didn don't thing we got it . was the only one who get it . it's only for you . it was report about an experiment with lot of users . and they had lot of findings in their report with statistical thing with statistical proof . so had three pages with findings and sev lot of lot of findings . so we can use this to create our own remote control . seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . that's lot , so we have to make beautiful remote control . eighty percent of users would spend when remote control will look fancy . this fits at the what what michael said about older people . older people will spend more money for something what's good . because younger people are more critical about where they spend their money money at . seventy five percent seventy five percent of the users say they zap lot . we we have to make good zap buttons . but that's one of our requirements . the last point is quite an interesting so if we . yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . martijn alr already said it . and our fold open system is is good one , but don't t's reachable . we should have the ten percent on the on the top , then you're you're so we have new age of forty plus . the ten percent on the top , . that that's good one . remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . that's exactly what we said about home station for for it to recharge the batteries . mo we could make clap system , so when you clap your hands it will beep . you must find it quickly . just button on the home station . so remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station . we can combine that . it takes too much time to learn how to use new remote control . we must take look at this . it's only thirty four of the thirty four percent . but it's tough one . because if we make ha whole new product , our own style , we we this is so difficult , difficulty . next , remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ . but only if they zap lot , and they watch over five hours t_v_ . don't we we haven't we mustn't look too much at the last point . the last experiment was about gadgets , like speech recognition . we didn't think about that already . and an on the remote control . we already thought about that . they finally had conclusion that younger people under an age of forty five are more interested in new features . and but they're more critical . and older people want to spend more money . but they they don't want to have lot of new features , because they're in their old thinking way . and they want to keep the old things the old things . but but you but you already said that the company was about forty plus clients ? so , so we just can skip the on the remote control , because . we can speak , we can skip speech recognition directly , because it's not reachable for twenty five euros . then have my personal preference . that's not very good , because about television , d_v_d_ player , stereo and v_c_r_ . had question about . but it's already out of the question , this . my point is , , if we ma make remote control for only television , it's hard to sell it for twenty five euros . but it's the exercise . because it's too expensive . only only for television on the market you can now buy for twenty euros remote control for everything . and we only make it for television , so we mi we must made it make it very special . but good usability , so you can use it . told about the home station . it must be simple , because our the the elderly people needs to use it . and found motto . and we put the fashion in electronics . and that's the motto we are referenced to for our our style . we we have to make new product . we have to be . one of kind , . so it has to look unique , but . the company is about our their own fashion , their own style . but old people are not looking for that . the main thing is the usability , that's where we can make it special product . to to keep it simple when you about it , yes . but we also have to stand out , 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of . but we have to make that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . so make it just different colour or different shape , so . this was my presentation . so paul , you can do the next one if you want . you can ask some questions . it's on the on the net net thing , isn't it ? there it is . technical functions design . , so we have broad audience . isn't that isn't true anymore . but we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . the way want to keep it simple is to use the sen standard . so standardised methods like on all remote controls . not too full , like jens already said , only ten percent is being used . so what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or . have it on the next page . but yes basic functions like numbers and that . so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . so it doesn't take much time to figure out how to use it . way to find out what people use is just to use questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on remote control to find out . but there is already in one done . of functions could think of . volume , channels , the the basic according to . just one two three etcetera . text service options . and found an could of favourites ? always look up the same pages on text and always have to click the number . but if you could make new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your no t's it was just thought . but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . so you might as remember the number . it's too complicated , but not . it's good idea , but mayb for me it's if use my telephone , never use those buttons to to to call sh never . so i'm , would find it handy , , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . but how can you remember what channel connects to what favourite button ? what was reading on the page . remote control just sends commands , basics commands to the television . so switch to channel six . so button six says says six . and if you make favourites , it can say six six six in row . that can be in the in the you said favourite never ? but for user to to remember , if press that button it goes to that channel . but isn't it hard to remember ? like favourite one and as as hard as no , neither do . so and if don't do it , old people it's not , it's still not it's not anymore just on the front as . now , not . no , elderly people . they don't like new features . play , pause . if that's usable when not anymore for t_v_ . miss did miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for t_v_ . no , that's the only the only thing you need . is just the channel what is six seven eight or five . the next and previous . previous know , but next channel ? don't thi li like web browser , so , . just very simple . but there's also button to go to the channel you've been before . like web browser back button . it is , but it's all too difficult for old people . don't have did , don't think you use that . it gets some seconds . only when you want to go to , just use when you wanna switch between channels all the time . and how do you want to do it , like if you have channel above ten ? normally you can press one , zero or ten plus or . especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . so you have that , the ten plus button . just one one pressing , or quickly after each other . to just keep it simple and standard features . wouldn't it be problem to because you have to be fast enough . the elderly people . mayb but that's in the t_v_ as . that's how the the t_v_ t_v_ handles it . but you can have button that says two two st two stripes . it's it's no it's not it's what paul says . so you have like five seconds period to press those two buttons . it's not remote control that makes the t_v_ do one two . it's the t_v_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must type one or two . so if you have universal t_v_ controller , you needed one button that has two stripes . so we have period of , , five seconds to press those buttons , and that and not for elderly people to look , one two press and aim and so don't . but do we still need two level remote control ? because if we only have that only no . it's only for television now . thought of another one . most things in modern t_v_s are also on the menu . so you also need menu button . and then navigation but we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , so you have four arrows . you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like switch channels and volume and that things , and the menu button . because you almost never use menu button . , but , mute button . it's still still good idea , i'm not . you'll also have to use mute button to to , not where where you have to put it . that's that's that's the layers that produce . now have to figure out what's what to put on . what we're gonna use . and later we can do the design . now my personal preferences . using the standards , basic that we should stand out unique , being unique with the design . so we have to , , make different shape than usual . so when you are in the shop and you see our t_v_ controller hanging , that it stands out . not just in in the row when you see all the same remote controls . does it have to be it has to be with different colours or it's like imac . we can give it out in different colours . you can choose blue or yellow or that's fa that's fancy . just to make it but it looks cheap as , because it's small thing . it's only twenty five euros . it looks very cheap if you make it , you just what happened . you can look at mobile phones . we have to look at mobile phones , . they they're designed very . and are the same , just bit smaller . you think you can't make t_v_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it . but , that's good example . we hurry up bit , because otherwise we won't make it . is it fin are you finished ? we discussed everything . the working design . the method used is search the web . just the web page provided . i'm i'm not very technical educated , but could figure it out . what happens is you press button , then circuit gets closed by pressing the button , like switch . and by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows what bu button is pressed . so like you press one , that circuit is closed and then the chip produces pattern . like morse code to and and sends that to the l_e_d_ . that's the light emitting diode , . and the light emitting diode is producing infrared light . that's un invisible to the human eye . and transmit that to the t_v_ . however it has also an visible diode that's blinking red if you look in it . and that's another diode , believe . because infrared is not visible . so that's er do two different things but . so we we also have to have led li led light on it ? is ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ? i'm not if it's the same thing . it's it's usable . or just green one , because it's if you use it , it's green or the red , it's green . depends on yes . it's in the case that it's active . it's not it's it's just the the . when you press it . but if you red's shows up like something's wrong , and green is like it's , you press the button . ma on on most on most remote controls it's red . so so know . we make it red . but don't have to make it red . integrate it in the design as . you have to the whole the whole remote control becomes green if you press the buttons . it's it is would an no . the batteries will be little , . no , we have recharger in it , so if we can still make that then but it's if it was green . but it doesn't have to be red . it's just to indicate something's on . that it's working . that it's not not the batteries are low . it's it's not very important , so . green or red or whatever , it is . just to indicate it's working . so so we have to make buttons for that as , to make it . and the receptor in the t_v_ senses the pattern . so we have to understand what patterns are used to , , to make it universal . so that it can be used with all the t_v_s . we have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can on the otherwise it won't work . the chip is producing the pattern . so we have to make chip that produces patterns to , , to . an automatically search function for each television , . that are working . or how it's exactly how it works . it wasn't explained there . use universal remote control , and list of all the t_v_s you have , etcetera . kno , have modern one . and you have to put in number , so it works on your t_v_ . and the modern one you you you type search , and the led began to blink blink blink . and after short time the television turns off . and then , it it's the one . and you can stop it , and then it's . so you don't have to search for your television or your code . it search the pattern for itself . so we use that . so it we have to make bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . because you have to . say can you just say it again , because was just looking there's just short . you have this chip . that's when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern . but ma for brands of t_v_ these patterns are different . so like when you press one on one t_v_ it go go to one . and on the other t_v_ it won't work , . so what you have to do is get these patterns . and by that can be done by just cha , changing this pattern all the time . changing the signal . and what he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , is trying to switch off the television . and when it's switched off , you can push button as it's working now , so and then he saves that setting and then it's working . that's the option . that's bit technical , and hadn't was little short on time . but understand it . the energy source is the battery , . that's connecting to all the components . because it has to be fed with energy . the subcomponent is it is the button pressed . so when you press button , switch get closed . that's connecting to chip . so the chip knows what button you pressed . and the chip sends out the pattern to the infrared bulb . didn didn't put the description by this one . this is normal bulb . so the normal flashing light . so that's the led , l_e_d_ . and this is led too . but this one is producing infrared light that's invisible . and this one is producing normal light . so we can make the normal one also normal light . not led light , but as normal one . to flash up your . if you if you use the buttons , both of them works . but one you can't see and one indicates that you use button . because when you button press button and it doesn't work , it can if the battery is low , it won't work . and it's unnecessary power you use then . so you have to indicate that it's , that's good idea . you have to put small light around the button you push . so you see green if you push that button . but if you if you do that , that you're sending signal . and it's you also know which button you , . but then have to be on the in the all remote control have to be leds . but it but does it make any difference for the energy you use ? everywhere in the is leds beneath the the buttons ? you got still one led . no don't , but , it it will look different , and we need to find something else . that looks different , . 'cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our motto also is , around the buttons , or in the buttons even . but like when you push it . then then won't then you won't see it . you have your finger over the button . so you can see . it must be around it then . or or on top of the green light is flashing or . not not not not here , but here . the same as telephone , or mobile phone , or what do you mean ? we're thinking about it . on mobile phone , in the dark everything lights up . if you push it lights up . everything lights up . that's good idea . why ain't that on remote control ? it it only takes little energy and it's not that much . if mobile phone phone can do it , it's , if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote . that's good idea for old people as . it's only few leds . but if we use battery station , which we will use . that's good idea , . we'll have enough power to . everything agre everyone agrees with that , or . what paul said , under the on the on the home station , button to to call your remote control , that it beeps . and then you , . and also it's , it shouldn't take much you also have remote controls with lot of options . but you have to make sound device in it then . there must be sound in it . it's that that's little too hard to make . especially for that money . because it's it has to be . twenty five euros , we can make it . production cost is twelve and half . bec twelve and half , . but but we only have to make it for television , and we must have something special . but we lose about ninety percent of those options . so you can . we have to give our customers some extras . we will save money with that . are you almost finished or just . the the personal preference , didn't fill it out . because was short on time . but what we could do too is have bluetooth integration . want to talk some about some more . so you have to ? so this , . wh what's that ? we have some new project requirements . we have to have look what they are . they're still in teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . so teletext option , we have to skip that one . don't , but , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . no , and lot of people use teletext , still use . it's only one button . so don't is we definitely should use it . that's what told you . the remote control should only be used for television . so that's easier . and the the forty plus people , already told you . this is problem . the new product should reach new market with customers are the younger than forty . so it should be flashy or just more interesting . that's it changes things . i'm about that . didn't read it . so does it make some decision about that ? then we have to make some features . that kinda changes the whole situation . doesn't work for twelve and half euros . the thing in the dark is good way , to make it more like mobile phone . that still stays . that's important and and don't don't t's very usable in remote control , especially when you only have t_v_ functions on it . don't you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you no . so , tho that's not usable . i'm watching the channel one . no , it's not but some of you had something to read about speech recognition . so , but . what other features can we put in ? you you have to make it bit flashy and and popular . and then the usability is not that required , because the like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good . about you said one and the television turns on one . is that reachable ? that's very that's fancy . didn't read didn't read any . it's very fashion . twelve and you've got twelve . only the numbers , only numbers . but only the numbers , one to twenty . that should be . we have to integrate that as . if it's possible . if it's possible , . but don't t's very expensive actually . didn't read it . why should it ? if if didn't have information about that . it's what but how that works then . you only have microphone in it . but it has to work . and and and does it have to work only in english , or in dutch too or and and ? nah , it's too hard to to realise that . that's problem , but only in english . only in english . does your does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever one to have in channel one ? it's probably my job to figure that out , but and and do you have to speak in in like in thing or , . no , that , then we have to think about that . but do do we do it ? it's more if we if we do it . so , is it very usable ? that's what i'm looking at . it we have short time to to put it on the market , so that we have to do lot of testing before we can do that . we make make , we can make the new remote control very flashy . and and in the languages are difficult thing . because we we have lot of languages . don't t's useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition . and and , and also if if you have good speech speech recognition , you can just throw the the remote away . someone says that give me one coke , and the t_v_ turns to one . it's not , but that becomes your because that's very hard for speech recognition . that's the command . and then you have to say t_v_ channel one , . but , t_v_ one . not just one , but dunno . but don't think , it just ain't useful enough . so we have to make some decisions . so you can see on the so we have to we're going to put on . no speech recognition . do we , do we make light under the under the under the numbers and everything ? do if you press something , it lights up for few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , ? we just take that one . and what else , we have , but it's would , that that would be the same . also the one in the dark . so it lights up when it's dark ? if you push something , it it all lights up . it it mustn't work all the time . but yes , that's what . it it have to work only when you use it . so if you no , if you use one button , it must turn on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . or you can switch it on . or when you . it lights up all . you have to , . that's what said . it's the same as the telephone . and do we use what's it called ? like imac , if you can look through it . or just normal remote control . just as an option , like we discussed , like ipod . it's good idea . different colours , use even different fonts . so you just make it through you look through it ? as an option . and so the buttons we have , this is , , this is normal . we put in the the simple buttons on the top , and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there . it's the standard , , we but we don't we don't really have any complicated buttons . but you have you had lot of different buttons . you have you have to when you use teletec teletext , you can press green or red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . but , the buttons are very easy . with just standard buttons we just have so little no , don't need don't need teletext options are only four buttons . but you can put the the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . because you ne almost never use it . but younger people more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext . use teletext as . no , use te teletext every day , . for me too , it is . so we just keep it one level then ? and , 'cause we don't have that many buttons , the design is most important . you can integrate the buttons in the design very much . 'cause simple buttons . if you put one above it , it's clear . so that's it for toda for we're going to have lunch lunch break . so , what you have to do . how long is lunch break ? this is this is it . you get your meal and everything , so . so , we're finished for for this time . we're going to have some lunch .
it's it won't wake up . was bit early . no , came in . normally was one of them . check check check check . why won't it wake up ? is it on ? the power light doesn't work . you turned it off . there it is . received an email with few possibilities on the materials . so i'll discuss them with you . we're just going to the later . received an email as . so we're going to talk about the conceptual model . which one was mine ? so that's me . so show you the the no the the the the the the minutes , minute . what's it called , . so we just talked about you want me to show that there or , we just talked about it looks . no , just tell us . has to look . usability is very important . people don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . it has to be very basic , not too many buttons . light switches on if you use button . text t_v_ still has to be possibility . and it has to be easy to learn . that were the things make minutes of . and the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , mute button , and text t_v_ button . that are the functions . so want to give you mike again , the first presentation of your . received an email . searched the web , and searched on this document , recent investigation of the remote control market . it has been done in italy italy and in another country in europe , forget it . but they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . so it's very important for us to create something new . so what michael just said , it must be some very different from ordinary remote controls . fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . this aspect is the most important one . it came out of the research . it is twice important as the following . the second most important aspect is that remote control should it technological innovative . that stands for new technical features . and then that this is point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of or speech recognition . but this is the second important aspect , and we must use some of the new technology , to be innovative . but we already have the flashing flashing light on the . we have to discuss about it , features not do not exist in current remote controls . i'll i'll get back on it . and that's very hard . the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . but that was an overall point . we already discussed that . i've got one picture . our our target group we thought about was young and trendy . so took that part of the webpage . and it says fashion-watchers of pari france and italy , , have detected the following trends . this trends trend it's not that meaningful for us , . but it's about clothes and shoes . but the the next aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe is expected to be spongy . but spongy , what what does spongy says ? spongy , like sponge . so rubber , . but that's al definitely good idea , because you've you're you drop your remote control very often on the ground . so it has to be flexible . it's something that it stand there . but didn't knew knew what it means . so spongy means . it's like sponge . soft , sponge . so it's also stress-ball . that's good that's good idea . somewhat like , i've some material information , but i'll give you it later in my presentation . if it's de like that . that's good , good idea . how are you gonna make it ? is it bit like like the the the the remote control ? because fancy look is the most important thing for remote control control , about changeable fronts . see-through one in fruit front . because it's it's hot . and some basic colour fronts . so we can make five different fronts to start with . an extraordinary shape , like sponge . or , , just another shape than normal remote control ha has . just something round in it , or not not , dun dunno . we have to discuss about that . main point still is the technolo technological innovative . how do we do that ? we ma must have some gadget . i'll get back on that . it's very difficult to to to do it . because it's only twelve and half euros you have to spend on every remote control . that's the problem . got also an email from the the technology department . that's the main problem . so we watch the first the next two presentations . they have done research about it , and even more possibilities now with speech . so they recommended using it . 'll check what they exact mean . let's first watch paul's presentation first then . so , that's the only problem . actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . but it's cheap and it's easy to implement . they don't say how much it will cost , so but if we implement speech recognition , it would be better to implement as . it's mass production . so you can say , you can . since you have to configure speech thing . but that's definitely more expensive than , but telephone , . that's that's something . but how we we're gonna make many of those . so we can start mass production , and then the cost will still will be . but telephone also have and and it's about two hundred euros . so we gotta de we have to decide on that . so , just modern modern but still basic . that was this ? l_d_c_ doesn't require . got an email and it says the chip can be simple , regular or advanced . and they say display requires an advanced chip . and this is more expensive than all the other chips . so it's the most expensive . it says in the email . the display requires an advanced chip . and speech recognition ? haven't got anything about speech recognition , but that's that's the most expensive chip , we need . i'll i'll give you my design . if we're doing if we're doing display . so we can had to make design . so did some searching on the internet . watched the old remote controls and news com remote como remote controls . we should this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . we should go more to the ipod and m_p_ three players . you probably have to make it bit bigger and bit smaller . 'cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides . and here you just have one , few buttons . so that's that's the main difference . but looks definitely think we should go like this . and then changeable fonts , so it's the most important part , . but and the home base is something like that , something simple . and then ordered the the buttons bit . on-off , mute . and two others , . the teletext tel no . text button , there and there . and then the colour buttons , if we want it on . don't find it very usable , but it's don't t's fits in the the modern theme as . no , don't don't like it . so and then we saw the the pla display , in the the ipod . they can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . and above ten . and no no . but it that's on on the display . that there is no display there . but it's on the place of the display . and we should light this up much more than that part . so the focus is on these two parts . so you don't see all the buttons you else need . but it sounds very difficult to use . because the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it . this is how it is now . so you can't use your thumb for it . here have volume . it is on on the bottom too . but it's not not the best best . here we have also side scrolls . if we can use that . do we want to use for volume ? i've i've got something of that too . for volume , or channel . then we can even simplify it more . by just putting the volume on the side . and and just channel buttons here . and the channels as . or the channel buttons are often used . and you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control . t's it's it's here . we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . they're on top ? just other buttons like text t_v_ . put that on the button bottom . because you can't hold it . you mean these to the low ? you can't hold it the control and push the buttons . except from the on-off button . but you'll use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons , like one two three . so we can put that on the bottom . but we'll , it's not easy if it's below . like zapping is just switching one channel at time . it's harder to zap . so it should be should be easy to . it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top . that's that's good , but . and if you don't light up , they don't you don't see very good . it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . so the focus gets on these parts and not on there . but the position can be different . it's we have to look what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use . so we can switch these to if it will look good , if you put those on on the bottom half . no , the the top buttons are . they sh those should be on top . those two , . but we we can switch those two , . and , , you have to make it's easy to yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , . that's that's my findings . so my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . m_p_ three player . and if we want to put in speech rec recognition , we don't think we should put it on top then . that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to switch it open . to use so if you put in speech recognition , you need so more many more buttons . which won't look good on the front side . so that's something we have to decide on . we have to keep it simple . we have to decide this this lecture , or this this this fifty minutes , , how it is gonna look . what we're gonna do . the component design . looked at some similar devices , and my own common knowledge . so this was on the web site . if you aim at young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . so flashy kinda colours . shapes should be curved , so round shapes . not nothing square-like . ipod is trendy . and it is curved square . but is has round corners . so we shouldn't have too square corners and that thing . not the old box look . and sports and gaming device style characteristics . exactly what that means , but it should be , , popular looking , . we have to put our real reaction logo as on the on the remote control . it's black yellow control . so the colours also . so we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . the sides in yellow and the the the top in black . not that weird , because we definitely want to make it flashy , to attract young public . but don't think the the colours black and yellow go together . we make you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . that's that's sen that's just matter of tastes , but we have to use flashy colours , . can't we use different fron fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? can we do that ? like fronts in in red and yellow and blue and . and still trans still still transparent . but with all with logo on it . this is remote control , very old one . then the components . the case has just here's black . but we are making it , . we make it som we have to make it from soft material . but anyways it should be transparent . we decided that , ? one of the options . you can just like mobile phone , you can make different fronts on it . so you can just replace them . we could do that . that was the idea , or just release one . just give five with them , just in box . or just sell different ones . but you could you could make like blue and transparent . so you can still look through it . like normal ordinary buttons . more , just rubber really has an odd look . it it could be like nokia , like plastic . with the hard hard buttons . that's better prob . the the the new new modern remote controls , the buttons are part of the the style , is part of the remote control itself . it it's one one out of one shape . it's doesn't is button how do you say it ? it's it's all on one level . it it didn't it it don't come out of the on the background . on one level . it is in the remote control . so we have to keep it on the one level . like the top it's . like mobile phones . like the ipod . just what material it is . it's chos so that should be hard plastic . then the buttons ? but you can make round fluff or soft material . just only the basic basic remote control from normal plastic , and the rounds of it from softer . and then the l_e_d_ . the normal infrared l_e_d_ sufficient . and back light l_e_d_s . so but we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work . so if you put . you can just make them around the buttons . if you the numbers could be can be , . or it runs the whole , you can halfs transparent , or just that it's comes out bit . but we can still make it transparent . so or no . they can choose . and in green colour , the back lights or ? different , , also . blue or red . whatever you want it , . depends on the colour of the , that's true . but you can't choo you can't choose it when you buy it . but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? you have to choose is it . but , it can . no , but there are multiple colour leds . is it's it's more impor more expensive . 'cause this mo mib mobile phone as . put some different ones in it . it's just no , just some led . have the mo mi have blinking light on my phone . and change the colour of it . just make it some different colours . blue , red and green , . it's too expensive , but it don't . we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . so i'm we can fit in . then some more technical things . what it is , but it should be there . this is the normal circuit board , like chip board in in lot of things . we have to hurry up bit , so . so we we just need this and this transistors and resonators . there's all these things . they they said that that's almost the same on any remote controls . so we we just need that . what they do or nah , but they just said we need it . you can you can change . we just , we have to make to yes . the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in . but , but it we don't wanna have ar an how do you call it ? we still want to have recharger , don't we ? is that still the recha no . just just batteries , rechargeable batteries . it's just battery . yes , rechargeable batteries , 's best . no , just rechargeable batteries . and chip , that's this one . then received some possibilities . for the energy source we can use batteries or kinetic like with the pulse watch . so it operates on your wrist kinda . so if you hold it , it gets powered . if you hold it . but normally you put remote control on the table or on the couch . don't will work , and or we can also use solar cells . but you mostly use it indoors , so , and and we can use the home station thing . it's dark in the room . it's just batteries , that's cheaper . cases , flat , so uncurved . two d_ curved is like front to the back . and three d_ curved is also in depth . so that's possible . but with three d_ curved remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . so we can't use the flat buttons . so we need two d_ . these kinda materials can be used . but it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic . the scroll wheels , that's . that's for the volume . scroll wheels , that's good . we can use multiple scroll wheels , if we want to . but just the volume is enough . for channels it's not handy , because you scroll too fast . so we need the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an . but we have to do something about the trend . don't think that's an opportunity . just skip it . because we don't have time for that to to put it in . then we we use must use the second most expensive chip . so so the regular chip . because we use scroll wheels . and , that was it . are are we using rubber case , or we haven't decided yet . just sk you have to skip that one as . don't think rubber case looks , . it it should be soft . you said so ? the trend is spong spongy and fruit or fresh fresh . that fruit and veg , or , fruit and veg can be just the covers . and now we have nothing about about those those two . just on front . so you can the the spongy , . 't imagine soft remote control . neith don't like it neither . can't imagine it . so just hard plastic ? it's mentioned here . titanium , it's too expensive . but the form has to be bit different . not the sh the square form . just bit more rounded . you can make it curved or round . but just in two d_ , not in depth . so we have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . because we have to . so the energy is the recharger . we already know that . just normal battery . we have batteries . the chip-on-print is normal one . the case is just plastic one . the chip is the the regular one . re , regular . you have the simple one , regular and advanced . so it's should be regular the second . i'll just check it . and we need plastic case , with scroll wheel . user interface concept . and flashy light . so i'm not . but we do if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . or should we do it in the next meeting ? i_d_ and u_i_d_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . so we should did it here ? that's for the next one . so we're staying here ? that's for that that's the next next meeting . or should we do it in the next meeting ? but you definitely get specific instruction . so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ? but think about something that's more rounded . just and more it has to be bit . but the ipod and etcetera , m_p_ three players , mobile phones . just just on the top or on the bottom . just bit cur , i'll see if see any of those . the wheel can be like like this . if you draw it like this , you get what the fuck is it ? you see what ? if draw here it draws about four centimetres lower than nah . you can make it like this . and this is all the wheel for volume . so that you just it's all rounded , so you can do turn this one . like very big scroll-wheel . but just not on the top , but on the side of it . so we have this at the moment . you'll get lot of volume changing when it's not wanted . so we'd have this . that's little problem , , as . it's probably better . and like this . but we can make plastic , so that you if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . you just have to make it that's not scrollable too easy . only if you use your finger . and what's the channel choose ? where do we put that ? still on the bottom or that's the numbers . wh what is the middle part ? the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . use the dz , . it doesn't make difference , if you put the the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . because you already have the volume here , so you can also put it here one butt and the other one there . next to each other . back and forth . so you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . because you have to hold it as . or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . but that's not want to zap very quick , so ? zapping is the highest priority . and then you use those , . is this opportunity , or you don't want different why ? but we we should bu put on top of each other , so because then it's it's easy to know if push the the the up , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is if you put them but but left to is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with channel changing . but still the next it's still the next one . doesn't make , but fo from left to is exactly the same . it ma it doesn't make big difference . it's it's it's obvious , . that's not not it's not al always the same . but it's exactly . in on most on most remote controls . every remote control's different . so so if we use that , they will probably have long learning time . you already have the volume on the side , so you can't make it you can't ma make mistake . so it's so but that's for that's for you , 'cause it's , so . it's so simple you just , i'll i'll take look at it . what did what else we have to discuss about ? think we need to work thirty minutes again ? we have to care that it looks really new . because we still hold on to the ordinary square remote control . 'cause wha what see the only difference is that we use scroll-wheel on the outside . and the led . no , you have it is the current controllers are all black and plastic . but it should be round in in shape . so no , tha that will be , so top down . you have to look at that image of the ipod . more that style . and bit some some bling bling can we have and how many fronts fronts do we put on the market then ? not not the old grey black where you can put ve we have if we do it like that we have below have we lot of room to put logo . the logo was has to be on there . or more or and buy the product . let's give five . you can buy separate ones and . you buy , you get one . or you can choose one if you buy the project . that's your choice , . so you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? is that is that good good opportunity ? so you could put it like that , . you sl you let it slide in the docking station . do we have to design that as ? the docking station ? we can it it could be just just square , just packet . but , that can be very simple . just where you're around something . li , we had one example . but we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as . but that's round one . which here you see one that's very round . we can choose then . so that can be all shapes . but you can just round up the corners bit . of the remote control ? just round it up . so you don't want this like the ipod . but more rounded . it will just look like more like this one . since it's this is also rounded . no , just just the corners . tho those are al already bit cornered . but then we have to think of something new . but we can we can do all kinds of as long as it isn is in two d_ we can use all round shapes . not in depth . but , if if we want to make it , , new . i've had lot of picture of old ones . and all curves have already been done . it's bit annoying , isn't it ? what do we do wrong ? just just more like this and not square . but we could do lot of , lot more curving . would do it like in this shape or . know we can do lot more , but it will only look more like the old remote controls . it it's very annoying . if it's handy . the olden the olden ones had looked like just square thing . but had lot of pictures show you here what the old ones look like . curves , curves . you've more there as . it wasn't very small one . that is for elderly . so we have to make decision , what form it's gonna have going to have . if my opinion . if we just take the ipod , and the same look . so light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . and just with together with the back-lights look will look very new . no rubber buttons . just together with the back-lights you'll get new look . more like the m_p_ three player m_ p_ m_ p_ three player . and you have the scroll button inside . just simple scrollb doesn't have to be . but why do we have to round it on the bottom then ? of skip that one as . though that's trend . if we want to make it . but , i'm not trendwatcher , you are . so spongeball kinda . the the trend is spongy and fruity . it's not not lot of trends found it the . so we have still one minute left . so just it's if you just keep it bit square . something about ergonomic fits-in-the-hand . but it's still for older people . you still have older people . it's only annoying if it if it's like that formed like that , like whatever . just you have normal but it is it is it is already fancy . there is one there's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and hope we can make it look not like the ipod itself . but we're we're aiming at young public . it must have very different , they're all the same . but you're if you look at the way remote controls are now and if you make it look like the ipod . because of the lights on the bottom of it . that's already fancy . so that's already very big change compared to ye . make the the the wha what's it called scroll wheel . make it in in yellow . just like the colours of real reaction . we could do that . but if you the front , the scroll wheel will still be yellow . think the scroll wheel won't be very big . since if you put it somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . so it will just be small small scroll wheel . so it won't stick out much . the ones we are going to draw there . we have to ask to the the to her if it has if it can work better than this . because it doesn't work properly . so you have to ask her . we can just open images there , and i'll paint and paint . i'll be able to do better job . that's probably , so just finish it . if you set the pen , he will draw here . so we make it bit like that one probably . i'll see it . bu , agree more like ipod . only the colour and the flashy light and the we just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . do we keep that ? then it that's very easy . or keep that ? but you'd definitely need advanced chip . and we we have to build in microphone and , and do anything about that . we already have the beeping of the home station , so strange that received the information about that . didn't receive any information on speech recognition , so fine . but the ma the main points just said . so can we just put it speech recognition in it as , ? we have to be original and technological innovative . but ma but we don't have any information about the cost . so shall we it open then ? so we can put all the . the function of that in there . and we need probably we need advanced chip then . we probably do . but it doesn't say anything about it , does it ? we started with information about the cost was now and how much is the chip ? have have some some information about the cost . but just about the chip . the the the and how how does it work ? how much , but just in inexpensive or but it's separate chip . our division has developed new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker unit . this is very small electronic unit , will give standard answer after it recognise question . is it no . just you say record , followed by your question sample , and after few seconds the answer sample . because so it works like good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning . it doesn't has to say anything . just you have to just talk to , we have to stop it now . does it say does it say something back ? that's just it's no . so just , that's that's that's advanced , we just decide not to put it in , because it's too difficult . it that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it . but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as . anything about this , but nah . it would be would be good feature feature . we just put it in , because it's good feature . no no worries about the cost , etcetera . we have to stop now . just we have to stop it now . and there's chip in it that will .
it's not saved yet . so our beautiful drawing . so just so this is our agenda . you're you're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me . so these are the so these are the last notes we made . if anything doesn't look , just say it to me then . don't have to put it in the report . are we doing the the speech recognition ? because we didn't have enough time to de design the inside as . but it's still possible financially . so if you want to , it's . then then we're gonna put it in . just slide open is quite usable for remote controls . just we have to design the inside then , but it should be it's may bit stronger as . and or are we making slide open , like underneath ? or fold open ? it's probably better . like underneath you can slide it open and you other functions . that's that's very good point . so when you have lot of room inside . think that's better . so you can make it very easy to use . 'cause you can write lot of comments besides it . so this is ? we're gonna use the advanced chip then . so that's i'll just have look how much that is . the , so . but , for the . advanced chip was for spee . no , you have different chip for speech recognition . so so already calculated that and it's still in the budget . so you can show your prototype if you want to . it's let's do it together . i'll give comments . we just made word file with the basic elements . the look-and-feel model . the form , the case as drawn there . simply square with round corners . so that's it . the material should be hard plastic . colour changeable , and also transparent . and colour and transparent , or just transparent , . then the elements . we have the functions are just basic . like i've pointed them here . mute function , on-off function , text functions . this switch channel . and this is the the num-pad . and the logo is over here , and the mic . and the scrollwheel , no ? you operate that with your pointing finger . so you hold it like this in your hand and . so how many functions do you need for for the microphone ? just only one button to say it's on or off . didn't have specification of that . but imagine that you have to input your voice . so i've yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need anymore . you have to configure it . so you can put it on the back as you want to . you can put all on the back . or or on the slide function , . that's we also how many buttons are required , or what buttons . haven't had time to design that , the slide pad . but you have lot of room if you can slide it open . you can put it separate . imagine you need at least four buttons . so but it's enough room . you write you wrote this , so . ll the main , the main zap buttons are most central . that was the the most important thing . so the best place , the best reach place on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at place they easily are , easy to find . the on-off button is bit bigger , so it stands out . that way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will will show up . scrollwheel is on the left side . it's the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as know . but it's not impossible to use it , if you're left handed . so because you can use your thumb then . just just one thing now . you need to have more one two you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . but you missed the no the zero and the two stripes . that's that's below that then . it's twelve buttons . just so you get that . but it's rather important . just we just missed that . but i'll just i'll get back to later . the form , we've taken that from the ipod , other popular technical device . so should be popular . the the buttons creating ? if you that or all round shapes , not rounded corners . so that , , you get bit round feeling . we'll use hard plastic . since thows us to use two d_ buttons , non-rubber buttons . and the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . we have decided in the the channel buttons , there's little colour around it . and also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it . and do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , colour you want ? so when you pre . how do you want to implement that ? just on the on the second level as ? we're going to implement . these are just basic functions , so all the non-basic are in . just draw draw the second level , because we need that as . we use this button for the . there is one function use daily , and it's not on the basic functions . it's to switch to your scart . play station or d_v_d_ player . that function must be , or you can lay it beneath in the other functions . to your video device . just make make just just draw second level one and say all options that are still left . like new blank one or or just here ? no no , just on down there . so just if you , , . and how does the second level come out ? it slides along ? it's you can do it that it claps open , but that's not solid enough . from from the beneath ? for the bottom . no , you gotta slide it . if that breaks then you're screwed . so it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . the the speech functions buttons . so what do we need ? just damn it . so you can scroll in the , navigate the menu . we can even put we have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit channels . and so you keep you keep one , you have one left . so you have one left for the , the video channel , play station , etcetera . so this is the extern . that's used pretty often . if you have play station , you use it every day . it's basic , to navigate . you want to save that file as ? that was it . so here are multiple speech buttons , how many . it doesn't really matter . doesn't really matter . that's we don't have any ? menu buttons with arrows . just like it's best if we do . where do we have or there . like normal , with in the middle menu button . like on the normal like this . the menu button , yes . don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . so you can't redesign it . one button to switch the colour of your leds ? and and you can hold it , you can hold it , and then the colours switch or multiple multiple buttons . just press it once , the colour should switch . press again , the colour switch again ? or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . just red , yel red , green and that's that's very easy , . if we have enough place , then we can do that . we can put those here . and then we choose green , blue and red or . that's it some text buttons . so did we miss anything ? some some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume . but there's one there's one text button there's one text button prefer . the volume logo . no , ma on on on the on the . just make it , just put it on those extra extra function as . or or the . that's the one that you use if you search for page , like seven hundred , and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . we have that on the the text button . do you do you did you think of that ? but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . you just switch it off and then we thought of text button . no whoa , the three stages . and if you press it again , you get the the the through view . the sta the state you . just three stages , you , that's . but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . so you can switch back from second to first . no , it doesn't have to turn it off . just remember where it was . it it doesn't clear the the page . if you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? yes , that's to remember . but that's that's that's functionality for the television . but it's not the way . if , as , but . that's one thing we can discuss about . nee no , if the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . in thi the the remote control in the the chip . if you switch it on . but you have to search every time again . that's what what happening if you do it like that . but it's still the television that has to do that . do we need to fix that or just like your telephone , hard plastic . most new t_v_s do collect all the pages . no , that's what the television does . those memory functions . but not not every every television , so , about one thing . was this logo for volume ? so that's it ? is this prich it , ? from which material are they now ? just hard plastic . so just , but you have that problem more often with rubber buttons . because if you use it couple of years , some sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are and we can write the numbers below or above ? it's too expensive to make it from different material anyway . or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ? just on the buttons . if you do it abo above or below , it takes more space . that's too much place . just leave it . don't think the space is worth it . just leave it . and the most time , with rubber buttons . what this means . but we just evela evaluated this one . made some criteria , so we can ev evaluate our model . you made some criteria . that shall show it . you have some usability criteria or . no , all criterias we just argue about . in the bottom . evaluation crit , evaluation presentation . no , evaluation is beautiful's is also matter of taste . it's not in . it doesn't matter it only had two pages . looked in the reports from the marketing strategy , or of the the the the the the new needs and the market . the italians , how they think about it . and the research about the the comp the the the users and that . made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . we sh we we we can give it number , and then we can give ourself an average for our model . and this these are all found , or wrote down . and we have to discuss about , if we give it one or seven . if you have ipod idea . it quite beautiful . it's we are actu we are the flashy . the the the difference be between beautiful and fancy look-and-feel is the the the outside beautiful like the ipod . and fancy's more like the the flashing lights and the colours and and that . we do if it's really , if you can if you can get the ipod look , then it's beautiful , . and and what ki what what basic colours were you thought of ? but it's black . the basic colours are black or green or yellow ? or you haven't thought about ho how do we make black and yellow . basic colours , . you didn't say . bit bit of yellow . can black white , ? do we have yellow light ? no , not really , but it's possible . not not not yellow , but just bit of light yellow . it's , different colours . like white , also ni or always . and what colours should the buttons be ? because , so what number do we give beautiful ? this is , the same as the cover . but also the light behind it . but can you change those too , with the switch ? no , no . make them no , just make them black or grey . just dark grey . beautiful is really subjective , because it has to do lots with the colours . have changeable fronts , so so . changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful . just give it one . it's just what you want . it's hard to decide for us , but . it's ju so subjective . it it's at least it's lot better than current remote controls . just give it two . the fancy look-and-feel . that's about our flashing lights and the background lights from from from the buttons . and we can change the colours , so that's really fancy . one more thing . so slide panel ? are are we changing or are they there backlights on the slide panel too ? or no back light ? no , it's only on the number , behind the numbers and that as , . and and the switch channel is there is back light too ? you mean this here ? but that's unnecessary . what do is necessary necessary item ? if you slide it open , it lights up . that's that's really fancy , but if it's reachable . it doesn't make no . then we do it . just some light to to light it all up . so you can see what's really there . not just not re on the buttons . just green light or some blue light . to light it all up . not not the buttons . and and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . so the buttons are just grey . just only , . so , that's how . so it's very fancy . so i'll give it , and you can also choose your light , so it's one . we've done lot of detail in light , so . ye , this it is one . this is difficult one , because we we don't , we it about the it's it's very easy to use , but the second layer is not easy to use . easy to use ? we shall test it but . it's that's no . no , but you don't have to use that . and you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . that's that's the main thing that's so good about it . so it's easy to use , but and learnable is bit just , it's very clear what it all does . it's not not as fast as usual remote control . because because the scroll wheel , it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . you must seek for it , and up or down or then the re . but the rest of it is very easy , because there are so so so it is learnable in the first place it's very easy to use . so so few information that you can easily decide what buttons for what function . but the second parts , like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn . it's it's device . and its scrollwheel is easy to use as , if you have ever used different of device . but we we've got the two so two two or three new things , ? and we learnable is in compare of old fashion remote controls . so we we have speech , the scroll wheel , and the the the slide . you must slide it . and that's not normal at the normal remote controls . 'cause learnable is less than easy to use . because easy to use comes after learnable . just easy to use is very , so just give it two . no , but definitely better , much better than than than avera average , . and the one you showed is just all buttons and you . techno technological innovative ? the speech function and the colour . the speech function is new . and the scrollwheel , backlights , slide . the scrollwheel and the slide . the slide is pretty new . slide is not is is not new . already have already have v_c_r_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . only saw it in telephone , not in an remote control . and they all have slide in it . so that's not new . but also slide that buttons come out , as ? and the the the lightning ? is that new ? for for there are no games on it , that's that's it's not one , it's two again . the lighting's new . it's pretty new , . speech is new . different colours , so . different fronts for remote control , that's new too . so we have pretty new it's it's it's not not . that would and we didn't but then we also have the the home station . but if you have . we are forgetting about that now , but we don't recharge . we didn't draw that too , but , that's just normal simple thing . but that's more like now . just draw it afterwards . if you can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? in the the project map ? just save , save as ? no , that's not in the project . t's already in the folder . like number seven . but this one . this one is not yet in the . no , it is . it doesn't matter . all the the seven , all the seven . but you still have to draw the resi the recharger . and new features , so we give it two or also again one ? no , if you have games on it , then then you give you have one . no , we are not extraordinary new . but not no , just so it's still two . tha tha that no , we we we searched for young group , audience , beneath forty . we are the targeted audience ? do we like it ? but younger than forty . so we we are exactly the targeted group . but did we reach , with our style , the targeted audience ? that's my question . you get the fancy things for younger people . and you get the the aesthetic things for older people . we've got one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . so you want , you get different colours . so think that's two or one . the only point is that we don't have that's that's that's this question . but it that's not not handy . and don't thi don't see . so we targeted it ? but we didn't follow the latest trends . you could make front front that's that's like like banana , . we followed the latest trends . tha these are the only latest trends get on my computer . fruit and vegetables , . you can different front this is power indicator . so we had we have fruit . like banana front . but spongy will never be . so we give ourself three . so that's eleven . that's what's the average ? eleven divided by six . it's , it is one point eight three . we're not too hard on ourselves . so you can see how far it's charged up . and and you need button to call it , to let it beep . that's still , we have to skip that one . call that's , but it no , we need that . but we have to make speaker then too . if you want to make it beep . no no , want that in . but we can we can do it underneath the logo . if you do , . that's really usable . the speaker is very small as , ? so got financial you saved it or no . did save it . let's have look at this one here , the production cost of it . if forgot anything , just say it to me . it just is battery . there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . so we are in the direction , because it's twelve point three euros . so this is regular chip incl and and sample speaker . so that's both . come on , it's perfect . twelve point three point three . and single curved curved . but but is it inc does it include homestation or can we make that for twenty cents ? no , that's not on the list . but that shouldn't be . we can different fronts , but standard front won't be , . the the button supplements , didn't was wondering if this special colour was i'm not . see it's it's like this . special form , . it's hard to say . but we have to , . special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . we get different ones , that's all . so you can put recharger in it as . but this is expensive , the sample speaker . it's four euros . is that included ? in the twelve euro or , then we then we need to use it . so we are . it's weird that we we get this information now , afterwards . so this is it this . damn , solar cells are expensive . so want you , we just made it . so we can do the project evalu evaluation now for for everything together . we can do some discussion about this . was there room for creativity ? paul , was there room for crea creativity ? so we discussed lot of things about it . if we got high mark for innovativeness or innovativity then there we probably have been creative . or different style . so there was . we could make lot of different remote controls . so it's creativity . so the leadership was there leadership and . what do you have to say about that ? who was the leader ? just normal discussion , . not one leader . one leader to check the time , etcetera . and make notes . so more like secretary . team work the the third meeting that one was pretty hard . we were not all we were not agree with every not agree with . we were not finished . we had so much information , that we get through email and just . we're not finished . we we got wrong information at the wrong time . that was the biggest problem . like the prices . if we knew that before , we could have had discussion really really quicker . because the prices could be twenty euros now . and if you had fifteen euros , then we would it . we had to . so we're bacal just lucky to get the price . but the teamwork was . everybody could speak their opinion . everyone listen to each other . like marketing said things and then we had to include them in the design . what have to say about means . the smart board is . digital pen is horrible . if you use it . but if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . it was just doesn't work . smart board would be very to work with , if it worked really . digital pen or , the drawings are are hard to make , . if if it would be faster , it would be . just not work too slow . it's it should be more accurate . and it would be if you could edit it from , just with mouse , from where you're sitting . not just pointing out on it . it's the same for the presenta for the presentations . you can do it from here . that's much easier than standing there . and so you've . and just point with mouse . no use to draw on the board itself . it's just slows down . just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . but you might as do it in normal computer style . even harder to draw like this than black board style . and it's far too slow this way . you cou you could draw on it , but not as main function . so we made it in time . and we made remote control . we did it . in the budget , . new ideas found . for for for to gather , or to work together , or new ideas for no , for the prototype . what it mean . just for remote control probably . no , for the project . for remote control , favourite for your text . but still , you couldn't make fancy you couldn't make prototype out of this . because we don't have any sizes and , but it you can't possibly do that in such short time , . but it's for the next team . we don't have to do that . this this is just the idea phase , the . details quite early . so are we finished ? yes , just write final report . no , we have only four minutes left . what do we have to do now . do we we were done at four o'clock ? it's now quarter past three . should take some pictures . we can do it afterwards , so . let's play minesweeper . found it as . one two three four five six seven cameras . so that was it . now we can look at this . this is the old versions . we're probably not supposed to look at this , but , from the previous group . they went for for universal device . the touchscreen , . but also different device . then an would be handy . here are the basic functions in here , the selecting dev devices . and touch screens for all our , . do agree with that . english is not so hard by the way . i'm breaking world record here . we've got problem , paul . you have to make choice . no it's your choice . that's pretty quick . you have to decide . just pick one . it's the lower one . bomb or not bo this the bomb ? no no , the upper one is the bomb . four in row . that's too much work . is that previous work ? that's so stupid . no , that doesn't work . no , you gotta use the magic pen . what if put one there ? you had two choices . that's gonna be draw . i'll put it here . then put it there . you are going to put it there . then it's difficult choice , either here or there . no one wins . this is very interesting design . it's just the same as normal . but then do it correctly . and what else do we have ? stupid , the screen . i'm going to draw something and you must , blank . i'm going to what you're drawing . no no , the new one . they just don't save it . you have to use the pen stupid . you have to save everything , that , ? no , not everything . pen , select select pen . it wants to we do in our spare time . no , it's only you can . it's , that makes it easier . it's very hard to draw . no , wrong . you're trying to draw , but it's wrong already . it's very fuck . you missed the side . little bit , but . no , you're wrong , you're wrong see where you're wrong now ? finish meeting now . the entrance is more to the left . but but but this part . but no you made another mistake . there are lot of mistakes , because the walls are thick like this . no , i'm not that whiny . but there was big hole here as , and there as . that's kinda big mistake . they're walking behind the walls . warning , finish meeting now . we have to finish the meeting . this is hard one . what does it say ? fill in the questionnaire . no more chit-chat . you gotta finish over there ? in your own room ? i'm gonna be so lonely . i'll clean that up later . this is that's my new interface . that's edited smiley .
we're the first . we're the first ones . marketing expert , yes . so you found your spots . move to the meeting room . where has my screen gone ? hello , good day . we have to talk in english , . my screen is gone . it's called black . kick-off meeting , . i'm afraid i'm bit slow for this . i'm afraid i'm bit too slow . how much preparation you did , but not lot . no , it's it was not enough . you see this beautiful presentation . let's get started . opening acquaintance , tool training , how to use the things here . project plan discussion , and then the rest of the meeting . we're supposed to develop new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly . so , hope you have good ideas . did my best . we're work we're working from top to bottom . functional design , then we do some in individual work , then we have meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera . and at the end of the day we should have prototype drawn up . we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . we should take some practice . have some instructions now to do that . how to the documents work . so this for toolbar . you see it next . we have pen . and we can use this pen to perform . so it doesn't always work . so you can draw . and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . each of you can take some practice and you should draw an animal . you should explain with different colours and with different pen widths . and you should explain why you draw that particular animal . so , julian . don't take up too much space . different pen widths , how do you do that ? with the format menu . and use different colours etcetera . are you serious ? and what's that supposed to be ? should it be one giraffe's yellow . it needs some some yellow format . can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? or so you must save it at the end and then , then make new one . you can press the next button , which is . that's some spots . i'll show you . in the file option menu . in file menu . how much time do we have to draw anyway ? 'cause take forever on this . do have to explain why chose this this animal ? it's it's animal . what is it ? it's it's giraffe . that's i'll will give it an an eye . see long neck but . it's more like dinosaur . that's of you . some leaf to eat . could you press the next . here you go . is this part of our acquai or introduction to each other ? introduction and get acquainted and that's the idea , so it's bit slow , so . your line broke . it's not that fast . it misses the spot . i'm guessing turtle . because it's slow . because of its shell . 'cause it's so 'cause it's green . you were slow too so . was bit slow too . dude you're good drawer . so some other line width no . do you have turtle pet ? does it have legs ? not exactly legs but more like fins or . it's more like tank . that's fins but where . they look like mole legs . with sharp nails on . it's looks very friendly . that's fr friendly turtle . it's fair enough . what the position is . does it have ears ? the little holes . can you erase ears or ? there's gum , gum to . and why did you choose this animal ? he said it was slow . it just came into my mind . so there's no particular reason pen . 'm i'm done . that's my turtle . your turn niels . how to select the next or here . here you go . makes new paper . colours were under format ? how am gonna do this ? not quite actually . not quite yet through . cat who had an accident or . they're my favourite pets . you have some ? have colour already . i'm not so good at drawing with this st shit . excuse my language . the pen , . how to draw its face . but you get the idea . it's my favourite pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , . or do need to use more colours and alright . you get idea ? we have financial aspect to this project . we can sell them at twenty five euros . the aim is to reach to sell as much as fifty million euros . that's quite big amount of money . and the production cost should be the half of the selling price . so we have to . now it's time for some discussion . what what do you want to discuss ? we should get started . i'm taking notes . we each have specific task , as saw in my mail . didn't you received the same mail . so the this industrati industrial designer should produce working design . the user interface designer should specify the technical functions . and the marketing expert should come up with user requirements . did any of you already do some work on this part or . started making an overview for myself , what had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step have specific task to perform or whatever . so had to , , make an overview for myself about what have to do , and let it work in to get ideas about how have to fill it . and do you have any ideas about the product so far ? started started with the first phase , was the functional . and let's see had to focus on the working design , which you said . how does the apparatus work ? and had two points . according to the coffee machine example , have batteries to supply energy , and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the t_v_ . and that's all have so far . got another point . it uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the t_v_ apparatus or stereo . so that's very common . it's some buttons for for the on off function . you you already told that . and for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume . that are the the basic options for remote control . kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions , 'cause wasn't thinking yet about that . you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also . what the word is in english . and what did the marketing expert do ? from marketing perspective , the function des design phase consists out of the user requirements . what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? so there are few means to reach that by by doing research to see what existing products are there out in the market . what functions do they have . especially what are their shortcomings ? are there any new functions which can be added to our product ? therefore we have to to do some internet search . for what applications do current remote controls support , and what are featur features of current and future televisions ? so we can see what needs to be supported . and we can interview current users and future users . what what would they like to see on new remote control ? especially for future users , i'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , and they play with lot of tools and so they have some good ideas to to add . and you can get that information ? get that information , . that would be very handy . but have you any idea so far as what the user requirements are ? no not specifically . more to how to get them and ? got some requirements it has it has to be user-friendly . really easy to use buttons , not not very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . it has to be small unit . it has to be , you can take it with you everywhere in in your house . so it has has not to be , gigantic machine . and and good zapping range . what do you mean by that ? the distance from your television to your remote control has to be , , quite big distance . it has to be capable for zapping . from the other end of the room ? don't have anything more to add at the moment . the best is to go to work . is that you or alright . any more points to discuss ? we can go ahead with what we have . will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . and it seems you get more information by email . so that was it for me . in the project folder . are you going to put the the notes on the . i'm writing very fast . hope it's readable . anything more you want to add to the discussion ? no i'm just bit wondering what we're gonna do the next session ? do we only have to to do phase one , the functional design ? because then we have . after that we are going to the conceptual . we're just working the three phases . you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting . and at the end of the day we have final meeting . and then have to prepare have to defend our design , so make it good . we'll do our best . depend on you . better make it . am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause it's fairly important to components we want to put in . if you can mix it it's . do we , is it gonna be multimedia control centre ? do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? that is my question also because like new new functions requirements . that is the user requirements part . as to what they want . do they want all those functions on that small . but but we need good communication about this , 'cause have to put the components into the design . so if what components to put in , it's hard . was like li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . we have first to start with the basic functions and we can expand them . you can always add few . so you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video . the c_d_ player . and another function i'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . and then use your windows media centre under your t_v_ with the same remote control . so with the switch , one single switch records and like that . you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for video player . you need play and forw fast forward and stop function . and you you don't need that for t_v_ . and and for teletext you need additional buttons as , so need to we need . you need additional . whatever , i'll just put my ideas in in here and then we can discuss it with the next meeting . in the project . we could just start with the assumption that's only for t_v_ and video . and reserve the possibility to add other features . so we have basic starting point and you can always extend that so make it's extendible . it it has it has to be user-friendly . so it's hasn't it's . the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera . and i'll see you again when the computer tells us to . can we leave now or . half an hour . you're di dismissed . alright let's move on . let's see what we got to do . see you later . see you later .
you all saw the newsflash ? or you got the same message ? saw it one minute ago . didn't see it yet . did miss something ? received an email so 't mail you so i'd just drop it in the folder , but is it unlocked ? what's wrong with my computer ? that's my presentation . what the not really . you have to change your desktop size . no no no . computer is not functioning ? yes yes yes . where do find this ? i'm not so display ? and then settings ? you read the newsflash ? no what was it about ? can we get started or is there some pressing issue ? my computer is not functioning properly . did you plug in the power cable when you come back ? no but my screen is reduced in size . so it doesn't draw the attention away . this is dreadful . made my own map . no not this , but the task . you have playstation also ? no flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened . where was it ? do you like your tasks ? spent lot of time thinking about what was gonna do and then couple of minutes before this get my function the information that need . wa wa you actually . but it it's not clear what you have to to to type type in your presentation . had whole idea and then just was typing it and then . have to do that so switch . this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so really annoying . so there we are again . by your humble p_m_ . this is the agenda . we have three presentations , heard . so who wants to start ? we have to start it away ? this is you ? i'm gonna talk about functional requirements . some research has be done has been done . observing of one hundred subjects in the usability lab using remote control . and they also filled in questionnaire . the findings were , you can see them for yourself . they disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . users think they're ugly . they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . so they they they don't match what they want to have on it . they are often lost somewhere in the room . it takes too much time to learn how to use new remote control . and they're bad for r_s_i_ . how user can reach that but . there is also was also some research on the most relevant and and and irrelevant functions . ts so they do need to be in the alright . most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass . screen settings for brightness and colour and like that . but they are used . the they do need to be on the on the remote control . if you can't control the the sound settings if you dislike very loud bass , you you need to change that . so we have to . by the way my t_v_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but . we we we can't my my t_v_ has , but we we can leave them away . next generation does . most relevant , most used functions , they speak for themselves . power button , channel , volume selection . teletext but we can skip that because saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's should not be used any more in the future . not used anymore . so forget this one . channel settings , so for programming your channels in in the order . by the way where did you get that newsflash from ? didn't get anything . on on the project no so it's text file in the project folder . was wondering but you you've got more information than . not by mail . receiv the mail but you don't . so that's in the presentation , so below believe . so teletext can be skipped . there was some research on new features in remote control . about an screen and speech recognition . got an update for the for the audience . or the the the targeted group . so it's above forty . the new product ? or below because that's pretty relevant . our current customers are in the age group forty plus . and the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . that's that's in the newsfla that's good to know . but where did you get that information ? that's in newsflash . because you see see clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features . above forty people are not so interested not so interested in screen or speech recognition . but below that age they they are . so we can build that in . we can skip this part as , because read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because they find it very interesting . have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . and and also there's so not only the design of the bus buttons but how you can push them , and like that . so the physical aspect of it . and and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , design , which does not make the remote control in your room . it's it's actually part of your interior , of of your design in your room . so it's the people can say , what's that , that's my remote control , so it's it has to look and feel , and and have all the functions that so the the logo has to be present , and the colours as . but it also needs to have corporate identity . present and the colours . so we can't change much of that . do we have . so but don't think that's that's problem because the thing has to have colour anyway , and most of the times there is brand present on it . so that's not gonna gonna affect it very very much . that are the the consequences on marketing part . it's open already so you can use to find yours . what is this ? how do no no no . you pressed alt four ? pressed the mouse button . it's that's the self-destruct button . you can do it from your computer so talk us through it . if you all go stand around computer no . had two examples . this one is the the the advanced one with lot of options and functions and buttons . this the easy one we have to to combine them . and merge the best functions of all examples . but the the age is under forty ? and and and marketing research stated that that that users are not afraid of of lot of functions . so we so so we have the option for more functions . so not not too much but . and we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech alright . and the speech recognition . this this one we can remove for kids . it's just only for adults so we can use some advanced options . from age of sixteen so . but but prefer we we use the the basic options . we have to to make them very easy so for just zapping around the channels you can just push one button . but if you want to to use your your video recorder else , you should use use an an advanced option . but the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . so it's very easy . so so there are not extra options in this case , but . we have to make it fashionable . like you said before . the basic functions . only use extra function if they are really needed . so you can hide them . what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen . you make screen menu . and the and the screen menu to to to to do that , and then the basic function just on the device itself . so it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , with clear menu . and the other oth other functionality is the screen . what does the screen do ? did did break it ? what are wh what . it's low power . so what does the screen do ? they said they needed it but what does it do ? what do they want with the screen ? for for the advanced functions . that's what we make it up . it didn't it didn't say what they want to do with the screen . so but what did the marketing no . my is it's it's pretty handy for advanced advanced functions . with no predefined we're back online . like searching for channels and . searching for channels , programming them . we have your never mind . that's i'm al i'm almost finished so the we have to to to watch out for the if we make it very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . so we have to make compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable content and form . content and form . now that that was was the end . that was the end . my presentation is bit sucky . you can improvise ? which one is it ? that would be it then . so we we can go for so we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then screen on top of it . have no idea . you didn't put it in ? or it's not really english . let me check . working design got it . here you go . alright how do skip pages ? was working on this before got my information . so was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about remote controls . and the info on the website which came too late . so didn't really functions we had to put into it yet . so this is an overview of what we discussed in our last meeting . those were my starting points . was working on on schedule , and was supposed to do it like this . but then the information came and it was exact with all the steps in the remote control that had to follow , so was trying to organise them for myself . and then make the the design , the actual design , but never came around to do that . so i'm not really what i'm supposed to say about it . everything speaks for itself . mean you press button the it tru goes , it sends signal to chip , which translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . and or temporal fr frequencies actually . and then through transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the t_v_ and the t_v_ will translate it into function . this was actually all got around to do . if i'm too slow for this , but . shou should we make list of the of all the functions we want . we want to incorporate in into it . for those that didn't see yet the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for t_v_ . it should be designed for use group below forty , but don't t's wrong if we can target the current customer group as . and the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . and we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , the target group . we have to make be clear what that is . group of users , or because it says below forty . so it's easy but it's below forty so we can decide where to . that's that's the tar or male and female six the marketing research started on on the age of sixteen . but it's it's also for children or just . sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that . so how do you mean ? so below forty is . but we need an lower level which to focus . so is it from sixteen to forty ? is it from twenty to forty ? is it from thirty ? sixteen to forty . people of sixteen are are quite used to technology . we we have to and if we have larger public we have more options to to sell our product . so they they adapt to it pretty soon . so what we might wanna do is cust have customised the screen functions , if what . the younger users are more acquainted with these machines so they can use more advanced functions . but elderly people don't understand it so , so they need simpler remote . and that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . that's that's why wanted to to make two different groups of functions . the the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people who are more experienced with na should put the the the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . but all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ? like like you have visual of the of the brightness with with sliding bar and bus and and like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ? so is you should have menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are . you can make if you make drawing . and draw it very big . no , it doesn't have line control , so we get the the remote , ? this is it's alright the remote ? usually the power button is on top . is on top . which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb . so it should fit in into your hand . left top or top ? most people are right-handed so left-handed special addition , but . if you put it like like here . then you could put screen , like on mobile phone , also on top . but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the . do the also with the thumb . so it should be little bit longer so that you can put your thumb , also reach the middle . or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . so you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . you you need to be able to hold it so . if you put the screen here , it's more about the functions now than the than the layout . that's for the 't help it . doesn't work too . it's it's bent . you broke it . you get it . if if you put all the . you want the normal piece of paper ? and you have pen ? and might be easier ? like if you have like ten buttons for for all the for all the channels , and here one for for that that usually like here , here , here , here . and the for flipping up and down . and volume control . so you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and for the volume . and left to . and those can also be used for the menu . but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors . but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things for the menu . and you you have most of the time you have one button in the middle . it says menu , and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and to go into functon and then just mo most of the time this menu button is also like , to to confirm action . so you scroll into it , . you select function like like bass . you just adjust it with these two buttons . then to confirm , and then on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to to upper level . and then finally say , exit . or or one button to exit it . in one time , that's not really my department . that's more your your department to to to . and do we need logo on our remote control , or on the left top . but it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top , . but that depends on where you put the screen . but it's essential that there is screen . the position of the screen is also more essential than we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . and for the speech recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need microphone . but so it should be if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , . this would be no that's not so we need display . why did we wanna put the display in the bottom ? that's not but it's screen on top looks more lo logical to me . may because you're but only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then . because if you use the functions your hand will block the display . normal for logical . also because people use mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . they're used to it . so you you just have to reach little bit for the power button . if you grab it . on once it's on it's on . but most most of the times if if if t_v_'s on standby people just press channel to put it on . you don't need the power button . we put it on top . so we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo like over here . and and the microphone , it can be very small . if you look at your mobile phones are some stripes , little little holes . on the top or even on the side . on the side . if the if the microphone is good . but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so that top is the best option . so on the on the top is better . but if you if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side . should be able to work . depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but that's . can we leave this up to you ? it doesn't matter that much . so but the screen is on top ? which functions did we have left ? this is numbers , volume , channel up and down . channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options . screen is over there . so it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the screen . if we it it's just remote control so . that's that's good one . so we we needed to integrate the sound and and image options ? like bass so we need an equaliser . if you treble , middl middle , bass . so if you have sound but not too advanced . most t_v_s use only treble and bass . and they're they're not used often so just sounds . it's pretty hard to write . but you have sound ? just you have digital better write it down over there . so you have sound . i'm just secretary . sound and then within sound treble and bass ? the mono stereo option ? pitch believe , . and there there was something else also . and then pitch . but pitch , isn't that that's the the height of the tone . the fr the frequency of the tones , . wh why would you use that ? and mono stereo . isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching . if people like talk like . and also the tuning part ? so we have sound , ? so channel programming ? and in the functionality of the no no of the remote do do we want the buttons to make sound when you press them ? as confirmation or whatever ? it it gets annoying . most mobile phones used that in the beginning but . we we could make an option for it , but you can disable . under the advanced option menu you can put those things . but the the television itself has also the the options brightness and screen colour etcetera . but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it's very hard to contrast and brightness ? so contrast , bright , and the others were in your presentation ? those are the most used . if you look at your monitor . so just copy those ? that these were the only ones , . but so we have we have t_v_ options , which is all this . will look it up . the button options and the options . the sound , sound and image . and you have in that the the remote control options . so we need two menus thing . you have button menu , which you can use directly , according to the old principle . and the options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared decoder . with the chip and then . so you you have an additional processor and and software part . we have power button , whether that's present . channel volume selection present . audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . screen settings , brightness and colour . call it contrast . con contrast is , colour and brightness . make it colour . and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ? so you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , shows on your t_v_ . and then you can and then you can select number in your remote on which you want to save it . so i've channel program is autoseek ? name channel , or they get automatic names , . most t_v_s automatically display the name , which they get through the cable . so you only have to choose the position on your it only has to match the the channel frequency on your t_v_ , with with the with the position on your t_v_ and and so your remote . but can you also say want veronica on the channel number five or . if you already programmed it . if you want to move it . that should be possible too . how do you call that ? how do you call that ? you you should be able to to browse through list , which displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible . like one to thirty of or ninety or whatever . just browse through it and then in some way see if it if it if it is programmed . can call it that ? swap's good option . so you most of the time if you if you swap it let's say you have r_t_l_ five on on channel five . and veronica on channel eight and you want to move veronica to channel five , most of the times you override the previous the previous one . that's 's up to mister user interface designer . it's it's pretty you have to look on on the menu on the t_v_ . that's you're but also , which buttons you have to press to get certain result ? he only has to figure out how it has to look . and how to use . and the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as believe . but you did your homework . or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote ? to programme the channels ? no that's on the can you make map with with all the 'cause it's now there are lots and lots of documents and the the layout of the remote control ? it should be able to do any remote . but the communication with the television is difficult . but that's not our part . we don't have to design protocol so no that's the . so we have figure figure out way to to do that easily . the autoseek is is not problem . you you current channel and then then it just says , on which number do you want to save this , and you just press number on your remote , and then say confirm , , and then it's it's saved . it's easier , it's it's it's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap . so we have to think of something for that . so but the user interface designer can design menu for all these function put them on the . structure into layers . i'll just try to reorganise things . so and and the layout of of the thing itself . so you design the basic function menu for the screen ? the the layout of the screen and you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the screen itself on the . isn't that more the the the user interface part ? no that's more in . all the functional aspects of the remote are in my department . have to it has to do , so if you wanna the changing the channels thing is , have to integrate that in the design . so he's layout and you're function . that's that's good separation . but do have to to to to make the the menu layout also ? or are you going to do that ? i'm going to make . that's your department yes , because he already knows what . we have to work together . if if make the the the the menu like , have to state which function has to be in the menu , and then you have to decide , it's , in in way that is user-friendly . but we're not allowed . you you are going to make list of what functions are are going to to be on the the screen , the menu screen . and i'm going to make menu with with pages and . with with some with some layers in it . so some menus . and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result , because that's always the difficulty . every device has its own menu . this this button , the the the , menu . or you can incorporate two difference different buttons . like for your mobile phone . so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it . and then one to confirm , and one to go one step back . so it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone , if you have nokia or like that . or the or the no button . to go one step back you it's only two extra buttons , but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen because this this is used for both . we we have to to group , to make two groups . the one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , and but we we have but that's that's not if you're if you're zapping with your remote control , you can press the the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the the the display . but they're incorporated ? up and down is smart ? into your screen . so you should leave the menu button out of here . you wanna separate . and and just put it under the screen , the screen . put it on top . just just group group the we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions . so we make line between them . but we should place the screen on top , ? but that's jurgen's department . so we make it . you just you just find out and . you just make the layout . you do we do the extra two buttons or not ? if you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing . so we have menu button and . and to , and back , also . and back button . or confirm and back . and the four arrows . but those are still doubly used . should we save this picture , or or what it looks like ? i'm i'm not clear about the the extra two buttons . we have menu button and that's the the one with the . that that just to to activate the screen . so and then with these buttons , woa , you navigate . menu button access the menu in the screen . you can navigate . but you can also navigate the channels . and the volume . so that that's not that those are multifunctional . those are both both . is it interesting for users if we put led lights under the buttons ? so that if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up . that's very good idea . and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button . that's good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use . so those buttons are are lit up . but just one thing . should we use those two ? or only this to to scroll ? and then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ? no we have to use this to adjust some some bars ? keep it optional 'cause you can go left to and up and down in in one menu . and we should use this also as an button , still . and then just only back button . have those buttons . the pr the problem with the button in the middle is , , is if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the once you , when you're not already at your choice . we use all four . so make one one button and and one navigation button . and one back . that was already decided . the with with the the channel and the volume multifunctional navigation button . that's what we decided earlier on . so wanna close down . you wanna close down ? have to , . it's not because don't like you but yh we have lunch break , and then we can work for thirty minutes , and have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes . and then we'll see . how how long is the lunchbreak ? we have to ask . nobody told me . but do we have to write to write down the our now ? or first lunchbreak ? no believe there's first lunch break . because i've everything in my head now so . or you can just ? you can put the laptop back in the room and . it's lot of pressure . for my not finished presentation . we'll kick your ass later . bring it on . if it works but it should be saved . aye you saved it ? does it save automatically in the project folder ? it's should be here . just put back my laptop . if you can use it but . you can open it with the picture preview or like that . and we have to make some maps with with the all the the data we gathered . try to organise it by these three . it's it's just my own map so put everything into the but you got some extra information . don't really mind . put the minutes here and we'll see . that's in the functional design folder . that's just what showed . but where do you did you get the newsflash ? got it by . you're the only one . i'm gonna get kicked if don't do it so make me proud . i'll try to . so first we have lunchbreak now ?
yes , made it . english from now on . break is over . where are are all the other presentations ? put it in the in the shared folder so it should be so . the conceptual or . what or whatever does it no no no , can you go back one ? because see only my own presentation . 'cause it has to be powerpoint pre components design , that's it . i'll just put it in there . so , he's coming . did get bit more done than the last time , 'cause knew that didn't have time so copy and paste everything into the sometimes have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , and also with how to use powerpoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it . 't cut and paste it into the other folder but move to meeting room . you can look at the final report , 'cause have to record everything we are deciding and such , so i'm trying to write it down between everything else . me too , . i've got the same problem as . here we go again . we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to the remote control has to support . so who wants go . who wants to start ? me first again or . did you open it already or no . so welcome to the marketing presentation once again . this time about trendwatching . there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . it shows number of developments . will address them in moment . fashion watch watchers have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , shoes and furniture . and the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . so the developments will address them this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . so to give you an idea . most important aspect for remote control happens to be fancy look-and-feel . instead of the current functional look-and-feel . fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . and the second most important aspect is that remote control should be technological innovative . stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . we covered that with our screen and and speech recognition , so don't expect that to be problem . and the third development is that the remote control should be easy to use . the first aspect was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . so that gets you this ratios . so fancy look-and-feel is the most important point of attention . so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . technolog technological innovation , we've covered that . and easy to use , don't think that will be problem . so my point of attention is especially this part . that this will be crux . so that was the marketing presentation . had only one document left . and shall go first ? don't mi don't mind . that's do you want to go first ? so this so small example . this this look . nothing about the buttons but just sponge thing , and and some fruit and colours . just made quick design . it's better than than my drawing . you're just the user interface ? but have to design the . you probably opened it . so i'm dealing with the components design . used some design examples we had from similar products . and used possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . that's why had to , wanted to go first . they gave me an idea about what people want . we're mainly focusing on this group , but want to make the distinction clear . could not drag the pictures into the the slides so so don't have examples of how it looks like . but it comes down to what you what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking type . if you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours , which looks like fruits , you can and shapes that are curved and not solid straight lines anymore . so this goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . there is lot of factors involved in choosing the components . there's lot of options that we have to discuss . the energy source . we have four types . the basic battery . we have hand dynamo , which we we dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . which will be fun for toddlers , if they wanna use the and solar cells . but how we would use that into the design of the actual product . wi an indoors . so my also also in countries where there's isn't much light like in scandinavia , they wouldn't be able to use it half of the year . calculator's can do it . so that's not either . so for the case , there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case . single curved , which means that it has curves in one dimension . or the double curved . wasn't able to finish my personal preferences sheet , but that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . the case materials . have all kinds of hard materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays . poo , this is lot of text . wasn't able to organise this yet . we have several interface designs . we can use scroll buttons for the menus , but we already decided to go for the for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . so that's not really interesting . we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip is easiest to implement for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . this is about it . was working on some per personal preferences . first chose for the battery , 'cause i'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . but really think that we should think about the kinetic energy , where you have to move the thing to be able to use it . as an optional feature . or combine both with with one . we can only choose one . you can only fit one source of energy on the didn't receive any info . we imagine that the kinetic type energy source would be more expensive to make . but it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . and it's more fun . and it's also more fun . always chuck my remote control around , so exactly . just playing with it and especially when the material's rubber . it can be done , , you can't harm it , so it's perfect combination . and throw it . you don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the floor and breaking it or whatever . so that's the end of it . so so double curved is like this , this , this , or . no it means curved in two dimensions . so single curved ? let's say would be square box , but then with curves on one dimension . and double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . also in in height ? like three d_ . one one very important thing was thinking about is the speech option . we were going to use that . so that's one thing which i'm not of how to implement it into the remote control . the visual representation is not there with speech but you can . no but it has to be combined with with the menu for functions and so . you can just match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . so don't think you have to design anything else for that . with the programme . but do do we do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? for for everything , also for the advanced options ? we have this very basic trendy design . everybody says it so that's what's in the in the last meeting we we were putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . pressing the the menu option will disable all other options on your remote control . and only the the panel will light up and then you can only change the the options . and and the and the buttons that you need to control it , . design has to be very attractive but that's your your op your . you have to delete this but this is the the the simple layout . display on the upper side with the the menu button and some cancel button or save button . that would be the back . i'm the back . you did read the minutes wrote ? you did read the minutes wrote ? little bit but not not everything . 'cause summed up all the buttons there were . so hate doing work for nothing . didn't read that . but but this is the the basic design for the for the for the buttons . wanted to to categorise everything . with speech display , sound , everything you you noted in your minutes . every pushbutton has has its own led light . so you can change make it more trendy for for younger people . and if there are older people they wanted more more luxurous so that's an also an option . that was it . that was it ? so what we have to decide is what components do we use ? energy source , chip type , case type . and user interface . but didn't see clear distinction between these so what we have is . so we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . the case would be doubly curved . so rubber material . and that's the only thing we have left . we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and and audio function . no it's easy . so that's is that is that the advanced chip ? otherwise you would have simple chip , just for pressing buttons . but we need more . i'm just thinking , this is not my department , but i'm not what this is gonna cost , to be able to so 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five euro piece . didn't get any info on this . that's gonna be difficult ? the cost of making it should be twelve and half ? have total here . didn't get any information about that so . we're going to produce it in china so it's no problem . child labour man , we love it . so it's cheap . is there new thing ? the interface type supplements . the interface , can . it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options . do you have picture of doubly curved case ? and could you put that in the group folder ? let me see . of the project folder . if you go to your homepage , you should get your own information . i'm going there now . got my fresh and fyoo fruity picture also over there , so no . it's it's easier . you didn't draw it yourself . too less time . also the menu . this is the the menu was looking at . was thinking of that also , with with with arrow . so that indicates that there's an menu under that menu . it's easier if you come over here . 's the target group . see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form serves the function , . it's like really basic . but this is more appealing to old people and we don't want that . this is what we're looking for . and that means curved in both dire dire dimensions . not only like this but it has to be exactly . also like this . so you can hold it . it has to be instead of the playstation , the module . it has to be like the the game cube , , where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be to hold . but it has also to it it has also to be luxurous for for rich people . and it ha but that's that's the the problem the dilemma actually , 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with lot of shape . this looks little bit like like for only for children . the children's story . i've got it . and , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , , with the there is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights . but the the colours , you you can make it make the colours with leds beneath the the buttons . if you press button and you can disable the the colour leds for for people that don't like it . we should consider this function . to customise it and so kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people who want something , , different , or more design , they can go for one colour like this photo camera . personally it's really ugly . just give me the thing that it's inside there i'm too old for this . but this this the is for the . very cheap cheap look . so those are all my . and this is , this is with the curved that . that's singly curved . that should be . could make compromise between that . but if it's worth the effort . compromise between what ? instead of doubly curved we take single curved . so to appeal little more to the all the public . so there's only in in this dimension . this , this would be single curved ? so curvy or not . so we keep it singly single curved then ? that would be an option . what you think . the our aim is to make something different ? to make something new . would go for the double curved . and i'm i'm thinking drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . so it holds nicely , something like that . but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . this is really your decision but . if you have it have it in your hand , you you you are not only you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . you can make trigger button like that . something to shoot at your television . or that that is the confirmation button , that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm . that would be way to use it but , , i'm thinking big already , and we need something that that that you can able to use in one hand . or one hand solution . so from top view it looks kinda like this . but from the side you you can have it also in shape . because the the screen is on top you can have you can have this shape . can turn it . to switch from buttons to interface . if you turn it little . so that the screen is more towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen . least you can easily see it . ll you have it in your hand so it's an angle from your eyes to the screen . so then you have double double curved in some way . so this this is so the screen is positioned over here . something like that . and the buttons are more , t's very thick now but that's that's ? understand what you mean . how about we do pop-up screen , like the laptop . if you can flip . so that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . that that you can press it and then it comes up ? and then if you want . or but then the side view can be straight . something like that . so you have the the side view . if you have pop-up screen . but if that's too expensive . so and you want to be able to make this . it's too much the advanced buttons . no like would draw it like this . let's say this is the side view . that you have screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . so that it would come up like that . so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . that's the the more advanced options were for the for the menu . that's good idea . but you you want . for the menu ? you just want to hide them all ? so activate and the . no not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . but you can hide the and the back button . and the menu button also because when you flip it open and you can even drop the menu button because if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto automatically . so but you have you need some button to flip this open . you could just make it mechanical . but you can make , , you can make trigger here . and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your true . that's but it's it's not it's not very very strong if you drop it one time . it it can go open . the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . if you cover it with rubber . an adv an adv and it will be covered in some thin rubber layer like that . so it can bounce . we just have to make that the closing mechanism won't break . it's very no it's very strong . it's very solid . so that that may work . that actually will offer some extra protection for the . but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . was thinking , if if you have your hand , it this is your . the lower part doesn't work , so you should try it over there . if this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that . with your wrist . that you , that it would be shape like this , . so it's easier to hold in your hand , to . but when you are left-handed , that's that's problem . then then you would have to to make it like this . can design two versions . but that's that's very expensive . like like you drew here . and then make this thicker also than the centre . give it would give it female shape but . and ergonomical shape . the female shape . we we could make some some rubber some rubber mouse , with which you can change and so if you . make it more appealing to . but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some basic shape . but but that's optional for later . we have to make we we better so choose one so we should better choose one sh one shape . and also the screen , you cannot mould it . no no no no . but that's the the idea , so it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb , you you can you can use , , you can use the button option spongey . and then you can you can place the screen here , which can come . so the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? and but then would would do the arrows here , thing . spongey can be reached by means of . and the simple buttons here , so that eah that's what . and and the and the control thngs in the middle ? the the the arrows ? no the arrow's over here . the arrows over here , and here the simple or do we wanna make its shape look like banana ? and then numbers . that it's design . it looks pretty fancy . bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , so it's better to have some basic print and then fruit print in some primary colours . we could make we should use we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . what what colours should the basic print be like ? like some soft green ? or and then , dark blue and then and then very bright , yellow banana , an orange , green apple , like that , with very bright tones . dark blue or . so you have something like . but the primary colours we can create with the with the leds on the on the remote control . if you we . if you make it just bl give it blue colour , then it's just neutral colour , also for the for the more for the people . that doesn't really work . to draw , . no you have to exit . you could also make line with . so that's so that's blue . two hours further . wh why not go for the twenty ? that's what call painting . and then on top of that . so that's that's dark blue basic colour . and then with some some yellow banana like . and how about some some flashing standby lights ? like you have on the samsung , don't like to call brands phones , the that 'cause remember from one of our first meetings that people lose their remote controls often . so it not not only in in the colours of the leds , that we want something to keep it visible times , or . how do you mean ? if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , . some some an orange . it's bit too much but . alright this is more like purple , but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is pretty high . that would be device . and which which colour should should give the the display ? the the colour of the background of the display ? don't it has to be sixty sixty six five thousand colour , so too expensive . and then you can use yellow or semething . so just just blue blue backlight like that . green is too old-fashioned . but blue , blue's . as long as you loo use high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . white backlight , and dark . white white backlight ? so that people with with and also for people who are bit colourblind . dark letters , . whatever which is visible . know you sh you should test it under under light conditions . it's hard to tell . no so that's mostly red and green believe . which which colour should the buttons be ? all all buttons ? no but they have to they have to have some colour ? that's how we are going to make it more trendy . or is it too expensive ? and if the background is very dark blue ? but don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? so the total of the thing is very bright ? you can flashy . like the pictures showed you . those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy . so more like doesn't work very . more like this colour . something like that , something that stands out more . and then then yellow and orange and red objects on it . but then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? the the press buttons . should they be white or black or but it's pretty fresh , on the other side . and it it looks quite cheap , that colour . it's it's not . it's actually pretty trendy colour at the moment . it's it's trendy . my couch is in that colour . and then time was up . do you get pop-up if we alright . within five minutes . that you have five minutes left or so something like this . left left and then have to kick you out . that should be pretty colour . but the buttons , all buttons in red is bad contrast for colourblind people . no that's actu red and green are actually the the easiest to discriminate . because the of the green . but the but the buttons have their own leds or not ? they have leds but they have colour . even for colourblind . they will see one of each as grey . but if you use green on blue , those colours will look the same . so red buttons are ? that that's default setting . you can make them red . the the red buttons . but you need to keep in mind that the leds are just extra light . how do you mean ? they they don't determine the colour that much , . was think about red red leds and blue leds and . 'cause you have to print on them you have background . no that's that's too busy . each number is transparent . partly but you have to print on the number . or the the sign . so you can't change the colour so . you better bet better better keep the led and the button itself in the same colour . so just an extra bit of light and attention . bit of light . you can what we should do is is make see-through plastic button , with one coloured led behind it . bit of feedback . so that the whole button will shine as the colour the and if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold for both hands , but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . with don't mean to discourage you but you two are going to work on the smartboard . next thirty minutes to design something so and the you will do the evaluation . of the product ? which we don't have yet . so wh how should do that ? you probably get mail . or you you or you send it to me . or just because you are going to design it on this board ? once they are finished . but you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make procedure which to follow . probably get instruction on that , how to do that , so make another presentation . kn 's gonna happen in in so i've basic idea . you have the basic idea . and you two are going to do this . so we're gonna work here ? on this sketchboard ? alright so that's . so make new page and be creative . but we have to do it at this moment , after this meeting ? you have thirty minutes . then we have to see something which we can show to the management . so this is the what what we are thinking about ? shall we make new , make new one . let's just delete all these or , next . and save this board . just save it . i'll just i'll just keep it there . but just press save and it'll be fine . on the left . you can also include clip-art . so if you'll rather draw in paint then look . so shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ? because 'cause have to focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . and then after that we can make the user inter interface . so how it's gonna look . and you have to think how we're gonna put the screen in it and those things . so if i'm drawing and you think i'm not gonna be able to put screen in there , you have to correct . we skip this . sound button press . do you mind if draw in black then ? you can also include it . it's not much work . for normal sketches . light only button user ca user interaction . no it's it's . so we want the girlish figure . so the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help because of they are only lit during interaction . i'm not so good at drawing . so t's good thing that the buttons aren't , that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable . you should draw it very large like this . but this part isn't functioning properly . how do we or insert text ? just start typing . it's bit large . that's bit big . you also do the other sides . not only on the front si the top side but also the the side view . let's make first the the the all the views . for the side view , that the the basic section would be rather bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and exactly but the but the upper side has to be bit more like that . the the front view , side view and the back view . what do write down ? why can't work here ? this is much easier . much easier , . the middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . don't see sign that the meeting is over yet but . no so work here few minutes . the display , we we can put display . don't you think ? so the display we will put in here , the basic functions in here , where it's most reachable . the the exactly . the the arrow functions . this is hard . what do don't have to draw it exactly do we ? no it's it's it's . let me try it one more time . i've it's easier if draw it in once . it will become way more ugly . you can make it larger . it's easier to to draw that's that's the basic idea . this'll take forever . it's fun to work with this pen . so , larger . five minutes left before the meeting ends . only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit . that's the question . but we we is it if if this is from the side woah . let's fill fill in the buttons later . so this is gonna be from the from . from the i'm i'm may it's it's easier to to integrate the the the screen just into this this bubble . because there the screen goes up like that ? so then it's like this , or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this . or does it flip all the way ? the the idea is that it has to flip up to here . because it do doesn't have to flip then . because we have en enough space for for making an l_c_d . because here but why why do we need the flipping . it's better to to have this like this , and then flip it like this . you can adjust the angle to which it flips . so it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there . you can flip it up to there if you want . but we still keep the flipping mechanism . we keep the flip ? keep the flip live . because it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger that . the the shape is but ? don't see the the why why we should use the the flipping mechanism . it would be . it's it's for for for more trendy because we have enough space . but but we we should then there the middle sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? here we got the basic functions , the the arrow button . and then we sh . and then like doh . so this is the shape . it hasn't but the screen is bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . it doesn't aim so . then it's no flipping or you wanted the flipping so but if you if you if you drop it it it just breaks . so there's layer of rubber on the side . so no flipping but just no . but most votes count ? and it has to be very strong because of the . and it's also for the for the children , it's for people not sixteen years . throwing and the kinetics . we better make we better make it like this . just light on top . if you if you're going for the kinetics . they are responsible enough to have mobile phone , so also to to deal with their remote control . but there are more . that the target group . i'm just thinking different designs also . ended the meeting . you two go design . remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like gameboy . by the way . thought up name for our product . we should try something like that . it's called the real remote . with copyright sign after real . the real remote . so you can include that somewhere . this can go . we should work in our own room ? we have to include that in our design as . don't see any power cables here so . what the hell's that ? it's the sensors . that's the side . but do we want options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? or just leave it ? could make an volume button scroll , volume button . or or also scrolling for the . we wanted to stick with the i'm just thinking , if we we wanna make something different ? so the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons .
first of all i'll start with the costs , because that's going to influence our design . if you if you al already had look or not ? did you do your questionnaire already ? no already did it . it's not much . it's just one question . because we have problem . it wants but everything is . if you look closely , you can see . already took the liberty to make some suggestions . at the moment we have fifteen buttons , one screen , one advanced chip-on-print . we use sensor , that's for the speech . we use kinetic energy . and we wanted the buttons in special colour . what's the first thing we should drop ? the special colour of the buttons ? no that's that's for the trendy feel and look . so , but the battery option . should we switch to hand dynamo ? that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things . but young people like that . so just do normal battery . just normal battery then , . it has to be twelve and half . so you're going to redesign something . so we're at twenty five . do we keep the shape doubly curved or do we go for single curved ? we'll have to go for single curve then . we have to drop on everything . but we can keep it single curved with top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat , and the screen screen is just you just have to hold it like this then . another option saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . that's what was thinking . that would skip nine buttons and four and half euros . let's do it then . and 'cause then they don't have to they don't need special colour as . then we have left . but we don't have any basic options any more . they don't need special colours . that's more like it . you were saying something . that was exactly my point . like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one we're gonna use the screen anyway . so we'll just have to use it for everything . and then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select channel , click we need one integrated button for everything then . some more menu options . so we can drop few more buttons . but now let's look . we could we only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button thing . everything you can do with with the menu . so with the display . scroll-wheel , push-button . integrated scroll-wheel push-button , . if you if you go to if you go to our view , like you if you are in the sound system there , and you wanna adjust the treble , this is just an example , you wanna see bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten . but you want sound preview of how it's gonna sound , ? so you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . so you'll you'll need joystick button . or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . so that's on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it . but you still but you then still need to have you can use the scroll-wheel as for for the channels . but you still you still have to have some some button in the menu to go back . so you do one inte you can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . and then just drop all the other buttons . not not sound . but but the cost of one integrated button is far more than few extra push-buttons . it's one integrated button is five times the cost of normal button . so we have to to make it more it has to be could drop the speech recognition . so you could also drop three more of these , without losing much functionality . you just drop the and the back . wh wh what what what is the what is the sample sensor sample speaker ? that's for the speech . drop speech recognition ? no but it's it's expensive , but we never considered the possibilities of speech recognition . 'cause it can take the function of lot of buttons . that's not very easy to use . no , it can be disturbed by by noise and like that . but lets just say that the speech recognition works . let let let me see what's more what's more popular . the the screen was more popular than than the speech recognition . have to look on that . let me see . no was wrong . there are more people who like speech recognition than an screen . because if you lose the screen , we need lot of . but if it but it it it's it's both hypers no , but we keep the screen . we lose our whole concept . so no we just we keep the . we need lot of extra buttons . it's it's about the same . eight one to ninety one percent , sixty six to seventy six . we we we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system , so we can might as drop that . so we drop the speech . and drop it ? let's drop the speech . fo four less euros . so we still have three and half euro to lose . we need to lose some buttons . if you lose the the back , the button let's say we only have the four arrows , and the menu button . then you're and the power button we have also . and then and then use the the . and the menu button does also does the function then . and then when you in the menu so so you activate the menu . so that's one euro . if we do two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons . with with one integrated button we can do the whole menu thing . and that would save zero point two euros compared to no . with the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera . no it's three euros . no it's it's . to this together is more expensive than oof , it's almost the same as keeping this . and we can drop these two . if you have four buttons , channel up and down , volume left , i've we have to keep that . it's the let's make the let's make the case plastic . and the power button . and then and the power button . so that's five . that's the basic . that that's what you need anyway . and then for the menu , you can have button that activates menu . or or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with push-button . and then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . click again , it's . then you only need one button to move back . or or under each option , you set you set an screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . and in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . so that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . which that's even , if you if you go to eight how to , we need the chip for the for the l_c_ display . but we can't drop three buttons . that's that's one euro more expensive . but see that's . so that's not good idea . that's not an option . because which buttons do we have now ? those five which mentioned , and then menu , and then . menu , power . of the four things ? so four arrows ? we have back and button . that's seven , and one to activate the menu , . and the menu . so that's eight . can't reduce that . we we keep the display . and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . we need the advanced instead of but but that's not our market . then rather make it wood . because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus people . but plastic with with special colour . no that not . but it's better than plastic anyway . no , hard plastic . woo wood wood wood colour . plastic with special colour . that's an option . no but because we have to use the special colour anyway . you forgot that . so let's go for the plastic . so we do one one . and since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ? that's easy because plastic is free . we still have problem of two euros . if we dropped ? no the buttons , those are really needed . we can't drop them . it's it's an advanced chip-on-print . you still need that . do we really need that advanced chip for an display ? so the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and which can use regular chip , wh which is six euros in total . no , keep the re . that doesn't matter . rather keep rather keep the display . because we already designed for it . so the only option is an hand dynamo . so and something else . that but the but the integrated button ? no tha that's one euro , . but the can't we fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'cause that will save us one and half euro already . and then if then we have to scroll through lot of menus to be able to get where you want , ? and then integrated but that would make it not so easy to use . no you would rec then you have then you still need two additional buttons believe . it's not that important , easy to use , but . for the volume . you can use those . at least one for power . that's three buttons and this would cost . it's just as expensive as what we have now . how many func functions can it have ? up , down , . it can be power button as soon as it powered on . you can go into you in you main menu , you can choose flip channel , you can choose sound options , any options . you you press it for like three seconds . then then then you should do everything in the menu . on the screen . it would save enough you can choose this , drop these , then we have half euro left . 'cause we don't have money and we want the screen . so we can still use power button . but we'd alright . we have to . it it saves us four euros and it costs us two and half . so let's see , we we drop the price by one and half . we'll we'll be on it says here . but we still have thirteen left . so still half . there goes the special co that would make it less appealing . drop the special colour . so that's no option . no no , it has to be curved . we about the advanced chip we need for the display ? they made it very easy for us . we made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's feature . don't think persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than buttons . wh what we could do is drop the the special colour , and do the special colour for the buttons . that's since we only have one button . but what is meant by special colour ? don't it's it's grey , regular . just something else than than black or white . grey and rubber . but we definitely want the thing to be special colour though . so rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour . you can still play with it then . but hand dynamo costs lot of energy to keep the screen working . so that isn't an option . the display the but if you have to power the for ten minutes , then the . you only have to power it up when you wanna use it . no don't think the current status of chips are pretty energy conserving , no . let's let's go for the hand dynamo then . do you want an extra button ? or or do we or do we do uncurved and flat ? instead of it has to be curved and has to have that colour . no no it has to be curved . just put special special colour of the buttons , . that's the most import we only have but come back to the drawing board then , ? instead of an additional power button ? or spe special form ? what what is special , special form . it's for scroll without but it's just scroll-wheel which you can push down . but we don't have any buttons . so do make it special colour then . but it's it's for the integrated button , also . ma make it special colour then . make it special colour and then it look fancy . so woah we're within budget . just ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . let's let's save it . let's do it like this , , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we all your designs are but that but that's the fun part of it . this was old . back to work . did save it ? it's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . wanted to go , but wasn't allowed . so forgot to save this . what's the next phase ? this the last phase , so . by your humble p_m_ . first should have had prototype presentation . but as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it . we went straight into finance ? it was more important , so pushed up the agenda . you have produced something about that ? and it combines with product evaluation . so we all have to keep in mind what has changed now . you put it in the . so what we have left on the because evaluation is based on the initial user requirements . let's make it big . evaluate the design with seven point scale , as following . the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . true or false , and then on scale of seven points , scale , as we all . the criteria are based on the user requirements , the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . they are in word document , which will open now . alt up freaky . it's open yet . and we all have to agree on certain level . the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . so that means the operating behaviour was using quite lot of functions . how do you think about that ? because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of , ? we dropped little bit of those . the us it it it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on lot of functions , in this question . so do you . we have extended menus , on the on the screen . you can you can ma , you can make lot of extended menus . the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen . so on scale from one to seven , what do you think ? two or three . two or three . two or three ? something like that ? have to choose one . so what do you say ? we should fill this in now . agree on two . say two , personally . in the new design would say it's three . but we have to evaluate what we have now . but now , in original design say two . then say three . you say three , and you you said al also three ? say still two , but it has to be three then . you're marketing , . so it's made bold . but it's nah , it's not very clear on the sc other colour , . or give it colour . it doesn't have to be bold anymore . the remote control has wha the remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . he types everything . it has to be . audio settings and screen settings . it hides basic functions . you don't use anything else . so it it's very true point . you're not gonna find them . it hides all those function . but , they're hidden in the screen . if you don't want to use them , you don't you just scroll over them . and you place them where . so that's very true , , for our case . the second point . the next not so much so . it shows the relevant and most used functions . do we ha still have power button ? check with the excel sheet . the button's integrated , ? we are it's in it was integrateds . it's it's integrated . we dropped it . you you just push it in for just just push it in for for three seconds , and then . exactly just like mobile . just go scrolling and it will activate . it shows the relevant and most used functions . on the other on one side would say yes , and the other side would say no . it shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but you say you double click on the no , not anymore . can you change channels directly with with just one button ? no , you have to scroll through the menu , before . with the scroll butt and then say channel . so it's it's not no . we should build it so that if you don't push into the menu , if when it's on , , it's turned on , it automatically has the the programme and the volume function , but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some of you or you double click it . but but how do you change from volume to channel ? no because it has four arrows , ? because he's now have scroll-wheel that you can push in . was thinking still about our integrated joystick . like on the the mouse . no we have we have no buttons left . so the joystick was not an option . that is bummer . so so you hav so you you have to double-click , , for , , volume , and three double click for the menu , . to get into menu . or hold it ten seconds . we'll make it morse code . but but ease of use was not very important , may remind you . no no no . so that's but that that's not question . it should be trendy . the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . it's in the middle . you have to search for them in in the in the in the screen , in the menu . im in the menu . so so it's more like five . would go for five or six , . five or six ? let's not diss our remote . it's the weirdest remote control i've ever seen . so t's different . just one button . the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like screen and speech recognition . but we dropped the speech recognition . it's still , say two . but it has at least one innovation . say two then . we still have the fruit and vegetable print . but that that's not that's not this question . that's the next . fr the never mind . thi that's the other question . i'm bit lost . l_c_d_'s more useful than speech what ? not the bold one . it's way more practical , . it has fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . it should have been two questions . realise now , because sponge-like material is dropped . but the look and feel . you still have rubber or no . so we still we still have the primary colours . no you got plastic . but only on the on the outside , not on the button . the button has also colour . the one button we have . still we we dropped also on the the double curve . you could check with the excel sheet . you only have one . we have single curve now , and no and no material . and and colour . so in the middle . it's worth the . actually we we didn't do so on this one . we have something . because it's an old one , with little curve on the side , and in different colour . still , it's still hard . the sponge-like and the three d_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . but then we would have to drop the screen . you like both . the remote control displays the corporate logo . couldn't , just one minute . you just have to draw it . but it be because we couldn't hardly draw on the on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the so wanted to put digits on the buttons as . it's the white part . we have we have . but there's enough space for the corporate logo . if there's only one thing . if we have only one button . so will say that is very true . and even the shape we have now simulates an and the reversed , doesn't it ? the remote control is easy to use . would say skill , would say six , . don't t's easy to use , or not so . the only the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . and that you only have to control one button . 'cause it has only one button . it it it has screen . it gives visual feedback . would say five or six . would say six . what do you say ? easy to use ? it's really not easy to use . five or six ? 'cause you're putting everything most votes count . no not anymore . so six , more . would go for the six too . so , another question , the remote control is durable . definitely in casing , 'cause we have hard plastic . if that's the correct word . but in use , both battery as casing ? because the the batteries , those thingies last forever . true , true . and the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever . and the casing is plastic , ? if you don't drop it too much , it's should last pretty long . so would go for one . but rubber compared is better . so two is more appropriate than . will go go for two . the last one ? the remote control's good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . no would would go for four . no we put the electronics into the fashion . because we tried to but we failed with the budget that we have . it's not , true . it's it it goes , it's not the best we could do , . but it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so alright , . so if understood it , we have to count these numbers . word document , the we have to count them . that count them . just add them and then divide them . or could somebody start calculator ? all made it po all made it all made it possible for positive questions , so we can count it . we can do the math . if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , yes . you have to . so four and work . did you make this questionnaire or what ? wouldn't be able to do it that fast . question number four , ? it's it's gone wrong . how hard is it ? it's your turn . just use there tho there's no there's no num pads . no it's if you press twice on the plus button , then you get no . that's why it's just count it to . it's it's bit . just type in the digits . they're all one digit numbers ? and then you can count them together . you can just count them by let's move over . three , plus one , four . three , four , nine . eleven , fifteen . are you here ? sixteen plus six . that was the last one . how hard is this ? twenty two , ? tw twenty twenty eight . that was that . so divided by nine . that's three or le less than three . the lower the the lower the score the better , ? twenty eight di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one . but but are you we this number actually tells us somethings ? divided by nine . so thr two . so we're better than average . don't because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . some questions are . so if you give true to positive , it actually means that the low the lower the better . but if you give true to negative question no ? but there are no negative questions . durable , that's good . easy to use . easy to use . this is good . fancy look and feel , that's good . technology innovation was good , because of marketing requirement . re relevant most used function . you did do it . and hides these functions . that was also good thing . and then matches the opera of the user was also good thing . so it were all positive questions , by by purpose . so yes , so the it tells us something , yes . becau but the picture would be lot different if we didn't have to drop those those things , . because now it's just an average it's remote . nah it it's it's better than average , but . because of the screen . but it looks and , it still it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour . has some shortcomings . the colour and the screen . so this we had , this we had . we have to do product evaluation . prototype presentation we dropped . so the finance we looked . we have redesigned . not on that , but so you can just make one big screen . we we have to if we have to redesign it on this with some casing around it , . it's your turn now . shall we try ? we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? the the button has special colour , the frame has special colour . but are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ? we we can just use this one . and then over-paint it with the green he only needs one button . one scroll button and for what ? or we have to delete this one or no . and single curved . and you might want to add infrared led . otherwise it doesn't function so . so that's , but how do we make the the scroll button ? do we have to do other things ? have to make an report of every decision we made so far . or just redesign ? and try to get chip just before receive the excel sheet . so i'm i'm somewhere , but you can help me . so you made start , ? should give it some time ? so that's enough to get started with , so , took one for every step and then conclusion . it's just one . have to take this away also . and this , . that's the infrared thing . the the target group has weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . current colour red . the playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as power sour . we did our special colour for the line widths , now that's ten . that's conceptual , yes . it's just scroll , is it's horizontal or vertical ? it's gonna be one str scroll . how many pages ? you have you have done the first two . horizontal's easier too , 'cause you can is it more natural than this ? and and the look and feel is . have to make an issue called finance . so let's say whoops . it doesn't look like it it's it's not . the items we had to drop . it's not very fashionable anymore . it's really ugly . where did we start with price ? twenty six and half . make it bigger ? or twenty six ? something like that . that looks little bit more that's special colour for it . what do you mean ? so we can make it special ? like other colour than this one ? or or speckles in it ? can we do it can we do print ? we have to choose , ? don't , if you see the options . we do have special colour . does it mean that shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ? red is already special colour , . so it's not very special , but . just put the purple purple on it . some some big dots . no my remote has acne . we have the original balance sheet , or . that's why we have that button . it's so cute . is that that ? how the we did we do that ? it's it's just one computer ? just dual screen . but can we delete it , just with delete ? we can try . that doesn't respond also to the undo . it looks like it's no , where do you want some more dots ? you can't even draw anymore . even children can draw . you you you push the button . or lot of options . can you just push pen and then keep on . that's the select button . it's no , it looks it's . it's not the prettiest , know . it's not so random ? specially the the . the and another . it's called the real remote , ? it it can say that . the real remote . just on the the the display . we can make logo . this is your real remote . like put it like the shape . something like that . it's not too that's not their logo , is it ? do they have lo , the here . this this is the logo . it's how shall we do the logo in black or not ? two r_s and one . you can just reuse that , because the name is the same . you can copy and paste the picture if you want . what is that ? look more looks more like campfire . are you dissing my drawing ? it looks like ribbon . so who wants to draw ? this is actually quite fun . do we need to do anything ? hear you people are typing . are we ready ? or is this the last assignment ? type in your report . don't see any new messages . or final bug . it's almost four . what time do we have to deliver the report ? four o'clock or or before that ? at four , , ? just compare no it's on the on the beamer . and copy this . this is really bizarre . it's it's somewhere it isn't inside . it looks like there's it looks like butterfly . no it's in inside the no it . and how it's or eject it . no , but it it's not bu beamer . from up there ? it's normal t_v_ screen , thing . you've got it read only . it's somewhere in here . so you have to . this something what's projection from behind , . it's too it is it's now single curved . there is some projection . it it's beamer , but then with within mirror , . with with mirror , ? so it looks like big screen , but it isn't . so are we gonna change anything to this ? is it gonna this is gonna be flat . t's it's single single curved . now you probably have to recalibrate . so it's flat . this is flat . it doesn't matter . it's it's that's the detector for the . but it's it's better to have in the front , this shape , because it looks . you see more of this than of that . more like that . and this is also gonna be nope . it's not very ideal . do like this . but sometimes then all of sudden it does work . but don't see detector over there . no it's you only need two points . no , you sh slanted . it was thing to put it on , and then draw lines . that's why it's it's not working , because it's more . or just messed it up . it it matters for the aim of this thing . but it wasn't good . you've to make it ninety degrees . it it has to touch the corners , . but this one wasn't good , because if was drawing here , drew line and then it came over here . you have we're always long . five minutes to the end of the meeting . and the recalibration is done using this icon here . can we can we get to that it's not working anymore . it's it's working , it's working . it's working again . it's better than before . you go ahead . it's only bit like to that side , but that is that one by the way . but it's better , it's better . 'cause this one makes the angle either like this . no it so cake . so if change this , it will go there , if change that , will go there . it's better than it was . will take this away 'cause it looks messy . five minutes before the meeting's over . we have to present alright . then have to write this , and if you have to present , because didn't receive any information about that so far . we get final mail . so it after the after after these five minutes , you have to alright . have still ten minutes to finish the report . what's this anyway ? after after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or alright . it looks like candle wax . and you can just relax and have cup of coffee or no , they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate . you can just if you ma finish my presentation . the presentation is still open . so if you finish that then you'll see next . we have to do the project evaluation . just do that quickly . what that says , we discuss it and so how were did the project process go ? how do you do it ? did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? or are there the interaction and the steps we followed , and and . do you mean the the interaction between us ? or at first was really stressed . because it went bit fast . but then as knew the tempo that had to be on , the second time did bit better . and the third time , , . and we move more to to working together as team , because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . and then finally you have some idea , this is gonna this is what we gonna make together and will arrange this and you will arrange that , and you have idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . so the process , , the interaction between us became better and better . especially after the first meeting . especially if if you see you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting . and was that due to my leadership ? you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that . you were more in charge thing . was there enough room for creativity ? but only the the financial parts . we were pretty democratic . li limiteded afterwards , but if if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of the the board and powerpoint and word and like that . so and the about the board digital pen ? was that helpful or . in in essence the digital pen is better than the smartboard . because it it it just works better . i've made , i've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . so it it's better better device than than the screen . but the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that . it's it's the the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we're all used to writing with pen . use the pen . and as said , have no idea how powerpoint works , so will take me half day to be able to make normal powerpoint presentation . but once get to know the program probably , , it looks better , . or something like that . you can give it home style , like we have the the logo and everything . finish meeting now . are are there any new ideas about this ? all didn't really receive , . it it's use especially useful , , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical . and and the screen and like that . the powerpoint is is too limited . you can't draw easy in in powerpoint . it has to be . the drawing board has to be integrated into powerpoint , so that you can just easily . the the the problem with powerpoint for me is that you have to put in the pre-made chunks as . you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever . but it it's useful to to show something to to an small audience , and then to . just for text , for text it's it's . these these screens this size are useful to discuss things . check your email . we should enter our questionnaire . see you in second ? that's the management . see you soon . we have to pull it this way , ?
