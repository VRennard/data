so we're gonna have like individual work and then meeting about it . and repeat that process three times . and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . so you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . so who would like to go first ? so this one here , ? my favourite animal is like beagle . charac favourite characteristics of it ? , high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take lot of physical affection from their family . and , that they have lots of personality and be fit and in robust good health .
superb sketch , by the way . tail's bit big , . was gonna choose dog as . but i'll just draw different dog . my favourite animal is my own dog at home . that doesn't really look like him , actually . he looks more like pig , actually . see dog in there . that's very good of you . now see rooster .
he's mixture of various things . and what do like about him , that's just to suggest that his tail wags . he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very affectionate and and he's quite quite wee as so he can doesn't take up too much space . and and he does funny thing where he chases his tail as , which is quite amusing , so it is . is he aware that it's his own cha tail he's chasing ? he only does it after he's had his dinner and he'll just all of sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . it's an after dinner dog then . probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . where did you find this ? just down here ?
he only does it after he's had his dinner and he'll just all of sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . it's an after dinner dog then . probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . where did you find this ? just down here ? what are we doing next ? we now need to discuss the project finance . so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and we're aiming to make fifty million euro . so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . and we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .
like on the shelf . imagine that's good question . our sale our sale anyway . imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . but , do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have bearing on how we design it ? away i'm wondering if there's , like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones . regions and , . frequencies as as characters , different keypad styles and symbols . for remote control , do you think that will be suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . it does make sense from the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons .
twenty five euro , that's that's about like eighteen pounds , isn't it ? or no , is it as much as that ? sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . i'd say so , . , i've never bought remote control , so how how good remote control that would get you . but , suppose it has to look and gimmicky . let me just scoot on ahead here . does anybody have anything to add to to the finance issue ? do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other other . thin no , actually .
do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other other . thin no , actually . that would be useful , though , wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now . interesting thing about discussing production of remote control for me is that as you point out , don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . it's just like getting shoelaces with shoes . it just comes along . five minutes to end of meeting . we're bit behind . like so like how do you one one way of looking at it would be , the people producing television sets , they have to buy remote controls . or another way is people who have t_v_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want better one .
like , what we could use is like example of successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . they're gone from being just like little scribble boards to cameras , m_p_ three players , telephones , everything , agenda . so , like , wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or , . or even like , , notes about what you wanna watch . like you might put in there want to watch such and such and look that's good idea . so extra functionalities . like , personally for me , at home i've i've combined the the audio video of my television set and my d_v_d_ player and my c_d_ player . so they all work actually function together but have different remote controls for each of them . so it's ironic that that then they're in there , the sound and everything it's just one system . but each one's got its own little part .
and you keep losing them . you keep losing them . finding them is really pain , . it's usually quite small , or when you want it , it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table . you get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make really high pitched noise they beep . that's just really good id . there is that something we'd want to include , do you think ? remember when the first remote control my my family had was on cable . actually had cable between it and the t_v_ and big like buttons that like , like on blender . and , , when about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still , , like massive junky thing on the table .
something like that , . or whatever would be technologically reasonable . that's up to our industrial designer . 'cause it could it could it could be that it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having , these days there's pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , . it looks better . nicer materials and might be be worth exploring anyway . so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . so that's about about ten to twelve by my watch . so inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on the actual working design of it so what you're doing there . for user interface , technical functions , that's like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do .
or are we keeping like design commitment to television features ? just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now . that's up to us , you probably want some unique selling point of it , so , . one factor would be production cost . because there's cap there , so depends on how much you can cram into that price . that that's the maor . , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . so , all for coming .
that's the thing , i'm i'm not because on the the company website , what does it say something , do they is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . 'bout putting the fashion in electronics . or , just the idea , but i'm not . so that's something we can discuss as . so those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , only control the t_v_ , and and incorporate the colour and slogan of the company . so is everybody with any of that , or do you want me to recap ? nope , we're all set . time for presentations then . who would like to go first ? i'll go first .
nope , we're all set . time for presentations then . who would like to go first ? i'll go first . alright , can st steal this from the back of your laptop ? so this is the technical functions design . go on ahead . to do the the design have i've had look online , i've had look at the homepage , which has given us some insp inspiration from previous products . i've had look at the previous products to see what they offer and would like to ask you for your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so , having look at the existing products , found out that it tends to come in two extremes , there's either very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you what you're doing .
it's supposed to be the same size , but it's got much fewer buttons . it's , , it's very spread out and , get the idea it'd be about this size . see , so it's more just basic . got very few buttons on it and , do we have any functions that we'd want on it ? it's valid point . like the one on the left looks quite quite complicated , and that p_r_t_ p_r_o_t_ thing is incredibly confusing . so see see why yo you might prefer the simpler design , but you don't want to lose out on , , what it does , so you get lot of remote controls where you flip the thing open , that's good idea . it's good idea . so far i've got on and off , switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . they're just the the very basics you could use for t_v_ .
it's valid point . like the one on the left looks quite quite complicated , and that p_r_t_ p_r_o_t_ thing is incredibly confusing . so see see why yo you might prefer the simpler design , but you don't want to lose out on , , what it does , so you get lot of remote controls where you flip the thing open , that's good idea . it's good idea . so far i've got on and off , switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . they're just the the very basics you could use for t_v_ . and then actual numbers for channels as , . you say that's required one or requested one ? which was that ? would you like the channels like the the numbers on thing , , .
es essentially what we're doing now is we're categorising . we're saying want this to be product that offers all the more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? is that what we're we're doing ? we're like sorting them an or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? to start with bit both , we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible . are you are you thinking what we have to have and what would be ? do you wanna just , at this point decide on what we must have as as function of this . so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and . there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . one one way would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go .
to start with bit both , we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible . are you are you thinking what we have to have and what would be ? do you wanna just , at this point decide on what we must have as as function of this . so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and . there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . one one way would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . and also think little bit about sorta what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . they're un they're they're they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory . so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip .
i'll add it later , the presentation . if we can move on to next presentation then . do you wanna probably not , actually . do you want to switch places ? can this can this pl reach ? can this plug come across ? so why don't pick up and move then . here , i'll just why don't er , can you go up behind me ? just just switch them . kinda this is so this i'm all in knot now .
just just switch them . kinda this is so this i'm all in knot now . it'd be if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ? so say already , whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be lot of redundancy in the in the the issues and the the the things . like overlap between what you said ? for all that that'll happen . which is ma not necessarily bad thing , but may what i've already started doing is cr created slide in in my presentation here so so that we think what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly have hard time separating separating things completely . what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts lot on what like market research that that i've been so how do how do get this up ? hard to where your role ends , . pr , press function and eight , .
hard to where your role ends , . pr , press function and eight , . function , the blue button . next to the control on the left . you have to push it together . that that's doing it now . try that again . think the the wire in the back might be loose . you wanna here we go . there we go .
who wou who would have the money to spend . where's the money , . if if like twenty five euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , don't i'm not really how much that will retail at . and who watches t_v_ . but you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one . so , who do you think we're aiming this at ? 'cause twenty five euros for remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? it's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , . is that too is that lot of money to buy an extra remote or replacement remote ? so not the high end range , but middle , middle up-ish .
it's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , . is that too is that lot of money to buy an extra remote or replacement remote ? so not the high end range , but middle , middle up-ish . you pay , what , ten ten quid for remote ? like simple replacement , . if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , would you how much would you pay ? this this kinda touches on your comments there , david . these are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is table of what people would pay more for certain feature . just gives us rough idea of where the the will to spend money on t_v_ equipment is . mostly focused around the twenty five age group .
this this kinda touches on your comments there , david . these are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is table of what people would pay more for certain feature . just gives us rough idea of where the the will to spend money on t_v_ equipment is . mostly focused around the twenty five age group . so do you think we're we're aiming at fairly young market then ? young professional , . , it's the . did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? do you think then voice recognition is something we should really consider ? what what do you think , craig ?
young professional , . , it's the . did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? do you think then voice recognition is something we should really consider ? what what do you think , craig ? the the older group . it does it does fit with the market that we're identifying , in terms of . we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause , there needs to be some selling point to it . so anybody anything there to add just young professionals , like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like really high response to that . so we could say that was our target .
it'd probably quite expensive to put in . do you mind passing me my notepad . there you go . this is just the working design . this is just what how would go about it . try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . in practical way , we it is . we've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're we can't we haven't narrowed down exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like besides the basics , back in the back of our minds we the basics are . has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , , which one of the basics are you trying to target . are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ?
are you are you all done ? more or less . ps , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing . you have transmitter , an input device , logic chip , , like that . this would be . and like on the means since we're on the topic of the technology , are there any like what are our options ? alright , what's what in is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin . these these aren't technology options in that sense . this is just basic principles and basic components that are needed . the basic principle of .
just to t_v_ , . something was wondering about was the power . is it worth considering like having like charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? is that something we really want to go into , do you think , or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? there's there's , from from from component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . you need docking cradle , , for you to put it in to charge . or you need to get the user to plug it in . and most users are very use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . but unless the controller's gonna consume lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries month , then don't think rechargeable is something we should , we really need to care about . so just stick to to regular .
there's there's , from from from component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . you need docking cradle , , for you to put it in to charge . or you need to get the user to plug it in . and most users are very use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . but unless the controller's gonna consume lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries month , then don't think rechargeable is something we should , we really need to care about . so just stick to to regular . so the i'm just gonna just recap what said at the start , was that the the whole point of this meeting was to finalise who we're gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product's gonna do . so just to recap on are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . do you wanna recap on that , craig ?
we include mute , but apart from that we just we'll go for the simpleness . another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? is it is it is it is it not an option still that we include some things just as under like under door or some 'cause what what i'm i'd be bit worried about is if someone was had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , , they get ours and it's doesn't have that . it's as optional functions . if that'd be problem . could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . one would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be device . this may not map very to advanced functionality especially , but that from manufacturer's point of view , from person designing the device , but from point of view of person using the device , t_v_ is something they see and something they hear , it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . like so what we could have is like three buckets , , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . it might help with the visualisation .
is it is it is it is it not an option still that we include some things just as under like under door or some 'cause what what i'm i'd be bit worried about is if someone was had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , , they get ours and it's doesn't have that . it's as optional functions . if that'd be problem . could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . one would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be device . this may not map very to advanced functionality especially , but that from manufacturer's point of view , from person designing the device , but from point of view of person using the device , t_v_ is something they see and something they hear , it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . like so what we could have is like three buckets , , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . it might help with the visualisation . and it would actually help with the component build as . gotta got five minutes to wrap up now .
no , not really . just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of clarity and when we when we resume that we'll use this idea david's proposed , where we think of these three buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is , , we're talking about this . that's definitely good idea . shall we do that , then ? just about the three buckets , what would go in the the device functions one ? things like on off . because they don't have anything to do with what you see . me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , , so and channel . and and channel . because the on off also goes , , like on off like power , not on off sound .
things like on off . because they don't have anything to do with what you see . me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , , so and channel . and and channel . because the on off also goes , , like on off like power , not on off sound . not on off video . although you don't turn off the video on your t_v_ , but you might wanna turn off the sound , say you wanna pick up the phone , there's mute button , , so you you have you have choice of putting it on to others or device . device is anything which we can't categorise , . so you're gonna have audio which is gonna be like your bass settings and actual volume hi . we put it out .
screwed in quite tightly . what did how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? we did we say we were gonna try incorporate it but we hadn't made definite decision on that ? should also point out that the the final objective of this meeting is to reach decision on the concepts of the product . so that's the end result hopefully . alright so is it function eight ? hopefully appear in wee second . up there we go . so let me just start this . so move on .
hopefully appear in wee second . up there we go . so let me just start this . so move on . where'd it all go ? it's not good . lemme just see where find it . this looks more like it . opened up the template . alright so let's have look here .
that's true , . i'm thinking however mac ipod is last year's because it's very hard and glassy and glossy , so i'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of mac ipod and we're then making it more of like more of like comfortable type of or more of like more vibrant to friendly thing to have . and then so this is with all that information what i'm what i'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more techni like production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . like like we think of some thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , sorta like marketing identity . does that make sense ? so so like threw out few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause i'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . like the ones the ones which i'm most fond of in terms of giving like theme to it would be like like lemon like that , something which is , like you see lot in in other areas . like see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and so anyway it's just just an idea . i'm thinking we could incorporate some of these features into fairly into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like like something to do with like lighting within it . like just within the simple sense , when you pick up phone and touch button it lights up , usually the buttons light up .
do do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this . let me just get this going first . there it is . that should be it . the same thing again , started with something very basic . so just so you have some idea of what's involved in my process , and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch depending on what your needs are . the components are exactly the same . like what you said , the most input that's needed is in the user interface . the rest of the components they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . like you said time to market was problem , and how many components are physically in there in cost .
no they're the sense that these are all the options available for you . i'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again bit later . then there's how the case actually looks . it can actually be flat or it can be curved , and then the different types of materials that you can use , don't think you can use them in combination , but could check back for you , but don't think you can actually use them in combination . we you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , wasn't i'm not very about the titanium . they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . the rubber was restriction on the power source you could use , but the titanium had different things on the shape of the thing , so that there is some restriction on you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but it might be easier from cost perspective and complexity just to use one . as opposed to two . and the other components are logic chips , again i'll i'll go back to the component chips .
plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , wasn't i'm not very about the titanium . they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . the rubber was restriction on the power source you could use , but the titanium had different things on the shape of the thing , so that there is some restriction on you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but it might be easier from cost perspective and complexity just to use one . as opposed to two . and the other components are logic chips , again i'll i'll go back to the component chips . the com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit and that impacts cost . don't think the logic chip has issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . power consumption should be about the same . the main impact is complexity , and the other thing is the power options . the first one is standard battery .
we could because the panel requires power , and the is form of light so that are you thinking are you thinking of of light in the sense of light light , or light in the sense of it glows frankenstein , it's alive . so one of the things we can just try and include is really good battery . why what light do you want are you thinking of ? i'm thinking it might be that for this to be high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it and that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that realistic goal one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ? illuminate the buttons . i'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching d_v_d_ and you you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , and that's what everybody does . where's the volume button in the dark , and you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up . like phone , like the backlight in phone . like phone , . whereas with phones , people charge them once week .
probably something that sits in your hand comfortably , feels in your hand . colour-wise you made re was it you or 't remember who made the point about how if you've bright colour you'll not lose it , was that whose about how if you have bright colour you'll not lose it so much . he made that . and when the corporate colour is yellow , we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow . and then the the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that unifies lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are our number one marketing motive is the look and feel . so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it come back to one thing that we all sorta can visualize . what we could do is think about concept which touches back to the on the the colour , you said company colour yellow . if we think of something , like was saying also lime and lemon , what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . we just come up with something like that we use it as theme to inspire the shapes and things .
something like that you got two groups there it could fold up and you get third group inside or you have volume controls about there . that'd be good . so call it the snowman-shape trademark . and colour-wise what does everybody think ? it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . do you want the whole thing yellow , like yellow and white do you want something . so reckon it'd look quite if we just had this here , had sorta background yellow , and then have bold colour for the buttons . and also how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? the fact that it talks to you , it might be quite if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics , . or when you like or if you turn it off if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere .
that'd probably scare me . you turn it on your control possessed . unless an if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an display , where would we put that ? would we put that on the inside or it's bound to increase the cost of it lot , would've thought . do we need an display ? what what's the functionality of that ? but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ? what would it achieve ? putting in lights is cheap but putting in an panel just to make it glow is bit of . l_c_ 'd when you used to mention the i'd wonder what that would be about .
if there is really , no would say no need for talk-back . you could put game on it . does anybody disagree with that ? when the t_v_ dies you can play with the remote control . so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , do you wanna group them into head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ? the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere . what else do you need to talk about ? where would you physically position the buttons ? that that has some impact on on on many things .

the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere . what else do you need to talk about ? where would you physically position the buttons ? that that has some impact on on on many things . you wanna draw onto the . so i'm just gonna pop this in here 'cause have slide about decision making which i'd forgotten about . sh we've got five minutes back we go . energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , what does anybody think about that ?
that that has some impact on on on many things . you wanna draw onto the . so i'm just gonna pop this in here 'cause have slide about decision making which i'd forgotten about . sh we've got five minutes back we go . energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , what does anybody think about that ? i've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , and watches , , , . no , like said we have hybrid thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just . support for it . just it's just worth pointing out because like i've i've known i've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery .
i've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , and watches , , , . no , like said we have hybrid thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just . support for it . just it's just worth pointing out because like i've i've known i've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . i've also known people to have things like like jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of nuisance because don't wear it all the time . like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down . so we should think about . suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either . so you'd have the battery as the to keep it ticking over idea i'm really we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as . so that's what energy is referring to here .
like so so backlighting , that would be good . could have things like backlighting the buttons and like that . or even clear case . glowing glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , but in the dark it , it's alive . clear , that'd be . aye that would be good idea . in in slight subtle way . so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can see through it . that'd be really good . is that what you mean ?
that's very unnatural motion to . can you imagine you have to scroll lot . it might work for volume , and some of the brightness controls and like that , but not for channels . if you have telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , you've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to . and don't think having that too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the . but then for for skipping large amount of channels you do have to to skip the channel button , the number part . but users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're like because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of . but that's not bad thing is it ? just wouldn't it we do need to make decision on whether we want to incorporate jog dial in and quickly . because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button .
like if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small . we really gotta wrap up so . it's small , and that we've got like the the slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , and that isn't that what we just said said we just have to decide now ? we can do that , . let's let's try and get the slogan on there , and . and then like jo and then like jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like like here , in with the it would get bumped , it's doesn't really fit with your hand . so you wanna expand the shape of the that that might have one problem in terms of in terms of whether you're left handed or you're handed you might be locking yourself in . or just fit it in like down the middle here . could could jump in and suggest something quickly ? i'm gonna have to i'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time .
we can do that , . let's let's try and get the slogan on there , and . and then like jo and then like jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like like here , in with the it would get bumped , it's doesn't really fit with your hand . so you wanna expand the shape of the that that might have one problem in terms of in terms of whether you're left handed or you're handed you might be locking yourself in . or just fit it in like down the middle here . could could jump in and suggest something quickly ? i'm gonna have to i'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time . is there anything anybody's unsure about ? just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , know that the designers are gonna be working with play-doh on that . so that'll be that'll be good .
the jog dial , it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , that'd be . one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite big impact on the thing that's what was thinking the slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand . incorporating logo is quite straight forward . there's lots of space for it but it's also marketing and function . that's design thing that you can can discuss , . , and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , and we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard . to make something flush with the case ? something bit more flush , , or have rubber incorporated into the case as , so that it has and also plastic i've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . sp kinda grippy ? feel like fruit .
they're al along this . just like inside there . you have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as , or at the bottom . 'cause slogans are usually quite small , , they're not like huge so they're say button's about say button's about this size , , so you would still have plenty of space for slogan , say even for that . so if this isn't to scale , what dimensions are you thinking about here ? want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with finger so we reckon that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . so that would be about centimetre for button , so one two three four centimetres . plus half five six seven eight , about nine total . about nine in total . six , seven , eight , nine , ten .
want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with finger so we reckon that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . so that would be about centimetre for button , so one two three four centimetres . plus half five six seven eight , about nine total . about nine in total . six , seven , eight , nine , ten . so we're talking about ten centimetres . that sounds good . that would be good . so ten centimetres in height . nine , ten .
didn't put five centimetres . like depth of the actual thing . do we need five ? don't think five is be about three and half . something by there . is this to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there . so you can power on and off , what else can you do ? three and half . you can skip straight to channel using these buttons . were gonna have the volume control here , but because we've got the the and the jog-dial we just thought we'd use that as the volume .
three and half . you can skip straight to channel using these buttons . were gonna have the volume control here , but because we've got the the and the jog-dial we just thought we'd use that as the volume . jog-dial for volume . and what else do you do with the jog-dial ? you can use it for more advanced functions like contrast , colour and . contrast , brightness , , and anything else ? just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , we didn't actually go through and specify the what can t_v_ do ? of the designers what are they ? things like brightness , contrast , tuning the channels .
you can use it for more advanced functions like contrast , colour and . contrast , brightness , , and anything else ? just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , we didn't actually go through and specify the what can t_v_ do ? of the designers what are they ? things like brightness , contrast , tuning the channels . that's good one . the various inputs . are you having v_c_r_ , are you having which input do you have ? probably colour or sharpness . colour , sharpness .
just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , we didn't actually go through and specify the what can t_v_ do ? of the designers what are they ? things like brightness , contrast , tuning the channels . that's good one . the various inputs . are you having v_c_r_ , are you having which input do you have ? probably colour or sharpness . colour , sharpness . lot of these things will have to be free and open for users to define them . what about sound settings ?
of the designers what are they ? things like brightness , contrast , tuning the channels . that's good one . the various inputs . are you having v_c_r_ , are you having which input do you have ? probably colour or sharpness . colour , sharpness . lot of these things will have to be free and open for users to define them . what about sound settings ? can you change any of those ?
probably colour or sharpness . colour , sharpness . lot of these things will have to be free and open for users to define them . what about sound settings ? can you change any of those ? audio , we have like your basic your base , your mid-range , your high range . the the balance . left-right balance , even pre-programmed sound modes , like the user could determine like series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be when you click on that then it would go to that setting . is there anything else it can do ? that 'cause that's that's fine .
we need an advanced chip , . let me just confirm that . the case , what does it mean by single and double , do ? single would just be one oval whereas double is this thing . so we want double-curved ? is there any rubber in the buttons or any , and we wanted special colours didn't we ? we're gonna have to skip the rubber . so i'll have to put that no we ho how many colours have we got there ? for the case itself , one colour . it's one special colour .
single would just be one oval whereas double is this thing . so we want double-curved ? is there any rubber in the buttons or any , and we wanted special colours didn't we ? we're gonna have to skip the rubber . so i'll have to put that no we ho how many colours have we got there ? for the case itself , one colour . it's one special colour . just one colour , . 'cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it . so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ?
we're gonna have to skip the rubber . so i'll have to put that no we ho how many colours have we got there ? for the case itself , one colour . it's one special colour . just one colour , . 'cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it . so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ? one and the l_c_ display . and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? how many we've got push buttons as .
for the case itself , one colour . it's one special colour . just one colour , . 'cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it . so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ? one and the l_c_ display . and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? how many we've got push buttons as . we have got some push buttons as . or even clear .
one and the l_c_ display . and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? how many we've got push buttons as . we have got some push buttons as . or even clear . like so push button and integrated scroll wheel push . so reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber . i'm not if that counts but you can see we're we're all very far beyond the could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits . let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . and special colour for the buttons , so four again .
how many we've got push buttons as . we have got some push buttons as . or even clear . like so push button and integrated scroll wheel push . so reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber . i'm not if that counts but you can see we're we're all very far beyond the could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits . let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . and special colour for the buttons , so four again . so why are we arriving at the number four ? where does the number four come from ?
four point three no ? my maths is all out . and then where is the . how much would that save us ? how much would that save us ? that will only save you one . that is one . the other thing could be that you could take away the panel and the advanced chip together , because when you do something on the t_v_ , the t_v_ responds and reacts as , so the user could be looking at the t_v_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t_v_ to respond , which is technically doable thing so . that's fair enough , . so so what's our reviewed suggestion ?
and the advanced chip goes away as . to be replaced with regular chip . so what that means is that the twelve buttons that you see there . and so we've got point three to get rid of . and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ? that's one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so so reckon reckon that probably counts as special form for the buttons . functionally you're gonna have to intercept so four is good estimate for , so you can't actually cut it's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve . do you think ? like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , how can it be something in between ? it it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is single panel .
no that's not the button we're talking about . that's the buttons only refer to the pad so should we take that off ? it's back to the original . so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost . ach that's shame . so take away that completely ? and now we're under budget . so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted . doesn't say so . how about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ?
that's good idea . does that mean that one button has special form or . there's just one button so handy . ll there we go . so i'm just gonna have to redraw this now . so we're not gonna have the anymore , and we'll just gonna have an on on the t_v_ it'll show you what you're doing , which is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here . was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ? what do you mean by profile ? flat as possible . you see envision it as being quite deep deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .
there's just one button so handy . ll there we go . so i'm just gonna have to redraw this now . so we're not gonna have the anymore , and we'll just gonna have an on on the t_v_ it'll show you what you're doing , which is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here . was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ? what do you mean by profile ? flat as possible . you see envision it as being quite deep deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat . that's what was thinking , to , . we didn't have enough play-doh to make it three d_ .
flat as possible . you see envision it as being quite deep deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat . that's what was thinking , to , . we didn't have enough play-doh to make it three d_ . al fair enough . just thought i'd ask . so there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add , and you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height . so just to to be thorough then , width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres ? and then so height-wise how how tall do you envisage it being ? about that big ?
it works , . about two centimetres , . two's not very high though . this is about this is about two . slightly more than two , so . see , about that thick . closer to three even or two and half . ach , that is . we'll we'll say two point five . so we have it within cost anyway .
we should do the design evaluation first . wasn't entirely what who was supposed to be doing that , but you go for it . alright so the way this works , i'm gonna need to plug into powerpoint , i'll try and do it as quick as possible . this is i'll just go over your head if that's . don't think you need the power , so no , that's that's . don't need the powerpoint ? no , the power cord itself . course , that's true . so then you have bit more freedom to you you still have your blue fingers . let me get that .
no , the power cord itself . course , that's true . so then you have bit more freedom to you you still have your blue fingers . let me get that . so what this is is set-up for us to use like the idea is that i've set up i've reviewed all of the the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as criteria of evaluation for the for the current design or the plan , and so we can review that . you killed monster . it's gonna end up being elementary because we're sort we're in we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but doesn't seem like it's going , does it ? there it is . and i'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be way for us to go through and decide if we're review where we stand with it . so so to bring together two things , design goals and also the market research that we had , when we rate this , one is high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , .
there it is . and i'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be way for us to go through and decide if we're review where we stand with it . so so to bring together two things , design goals and also the market research that we had , when we rate this , one is high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , . so these these are the and we've been asked to to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just work on consensus system so we just come to an agreement . so the first one , stylish look and feel . rate that pretty highly . compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good . me my only reservation with it was that we went with yellow because it's the company's colour , and if yellow's gonna really be hit . what does anybody else think ? but what do you think ?
but what do you think ? i'm seeing five then . would say five or six . i'm fine with that . let's go with five then . fi just actually the opposite . it's one to seven , ? the so it meant three , . yes then , then would say two or three . what's the scale , one to seven , ?
one's high-ish isn't it ? one is high . so , two or three . let's go with two point five then . control high tech innovation . has the wee jog-dial but . we had to remove , so we've had to remove few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial 's good . i'd go with three or four , three . say it's more medium , but going towards little bit higher than medium thing . about three , .
the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , except for the the the red button , they because for want of , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , but the button itself , the blue can be anything else . so we'll go two . and design is simple to use , simple in features . it's really basic looking isn't it ? fairly basic , you think ? i'd give that nearly one . soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? we've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite bit of compromise for price . it's about five . that's really low .
i'd give that nearly one . soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? we've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite bit of compromise for price . it's about five . that's really low . we have to use plastic so it's probably gonna be i'd probably increase the cost . that's could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? was that an option ? it'll be cost prohibitive , . we've only got like what , ten cents left so .
it'll be cost prohibitive , . we've only got like what , ten cents left so . it would cost more than plastic . logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there ? and it's within budget , . it is , isn't it ? so we can say then that out of possible or what would be our goal here ? out of forty nine , . out of forty nine with with zero being the highest .
gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there ? and it's within budget , . it is , isn't it ? so we can say then that out of possible or what would be our goal here ? out of forty nine , . out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . we are at two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . 's pretty good . so it's pretty good . translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal .
and it's within budget , . it is , isn't it ? so we can say then that out of possible or what would be our goal here ? out of forty nine , . out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . we are at two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . 's pretty good . so it's pretty good . translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . 'cause if you turn that into hundred it would be about about thirty one , and then invert that , it's , about seventy , seventy percent .
out of forty nine , . out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . we are at two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . 's pretty good . so it's pretty good . translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . 'cause if you turn that into hundred it would be about about thirty one , and then invert that , it's , about seventy , seventy percent . twice that , about thirty one . so ab about sixty nine , seventy percent . it's pretty good .
to record it and haven't been asked to submit it yet . just wondering if need to include it in the minutes , because if you're submitting it anyway then . it keeps getting too big . next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation . i'm i'm listening i'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so i'm playing with the play-doh as . just in case you're wondering , why is he still playing with the play-doh ? just about l_e_g_o_ lego . do you wanna just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points , my four points , , forgotten that . you got different , they're good aren't they , . like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that .
just about l_e_g_o_ lego . do you wanna just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points , my four points , , forgotten that . you got different , they're good aren't they , . like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . it's really quick . here we are . as note we'll do this alphabetically . do you wanna start andrew ? so what is it you're asking of me now ? just your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them .
just your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them . or our work on setting this up . is it i'll just go through your system then . the the room is fairly institutional , but the main thing is , our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to have cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , , as in other words this this room is centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just debating , but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we put out our ideas and then , . do you feel though that that you were able to have quite lot of creative input into the thing ? but don't don't means the room as in this room . it means like . , room for creativ looked up and saw whiteboard , digital pens , the room . no , , . dunno do you it means it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so .
reckon that was bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have quick talk with them , that would've been lot easier . did did you get the email sent you ? not just yet . got the email . was wondering if that got there . so to to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier . in it , , , exactly . the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , that's the word . they don't support the team working together , , they're still very individual tools .
not just yet . got the email . was wondering if that got there . so to to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier . in it , , , exactly . the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , that's the word . they don't support the team working together , , they're still very individual tools . if you , taking upon that idea , the way see this is that it's the the the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the principle of teamwork because the the tasks were divided , and then the work went on in isolation what you did while you were together , that was bit different , but , but but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said , first thing we have to do is come up with let's say design concept , and we sit here together and do it , that's what teamwork is . we had play-doh fun . to to say go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork .
no , not really . what about the how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , like that ? did anybody think anything was like really useful , anything was pretty un unsupportive ? the whiteboard , for me , is the thing would use all the time , but it's not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on board as opposed to in like in text . and then we could then keep our ideas building on that . know that people who design cars and in aviation they quite often just have simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as context to walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . and point at ? it wasn't until we had this here , , like at one point peeked across and looked at craig's paper and i'm like , now he's thinking 'cause saw his book . but the the whiteboard could've actually been this continuing think could be , . so do you think producing prototype earlier in the process woulda been good idea ?
the whiteboard , for me , is the thing would use all the time , but it's not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on board as opposed to in like in text . and then we could then keep our ideas building on that . know that people who design cars and in aviation they quite often just have simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as context to walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . and point at ? it wasn't until we had this here , , like at one point peeked across and looked at craig's paper and i'm like , now he's thinking 'cause saw his book . but the the whiteboard could've actually been this continuing think could be , . so do you think producing prototype earlier in the process woulda been good idea ? the the focus of it lot was the powerpoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , and that is also does hinder us and things . it will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the powerpoint , or the whiteboard and the powerpoint in the same place , in the centre of the that there were too many powerpoints in the meetings . because the powerpoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas imagine if i'd been encouraged to use paintbrush , , or whatever , would've actually used it , 'ca , just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time .
they're bit clunky . having to tick it before you go off was bit hindering as , 'cause you're half way through thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump . know , at the very start of today like wrote whole load of , didn't click note on one , then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , and so i'm quite worried that i've just written over the top of it , but they'll have my paper anyway and haven't done that since . but the pen is is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we don't have to worry . so the pen's good . it's about the best thing . and on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . it just occurred to me that they all we only actually needed one computer . we only needed one computer and and the computer may not be conducive to meeting because you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , , it's useful but too many computers are just distracting . if there had been fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time .
it's just logo . just logo and then like ninja homer , . the the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it . you can wear homer , you can throw homer when you're frustrated , doh . no , that's , it's got i'm i'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , that would have been . from now on real reaction should give us more money . did learn something new , play-doh is useful . no it is it is . it is useful and in in in in in in in conceptualizing , in being creative . 'cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get sense for .
like the for it has to be , . no , all play-doh is edible . they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds . it's just wheat , it's the that your mom could make with preservatives and it's helpful to the creative process . so to wha what are your summarising words about play-doh ? it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . and it helps you to understand dimension as . that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up , whereas on piece of paper , on computer , on board , even with three d_ graphic thing it still , it requires lot of tangible , that's word . it's not very tangible . it becomes tangible .
it's about that . and that's quite lot for remote control . my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . as you said they come with the t_v_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , so we could think about colour ? make that might make it bit different from the rest at least . and as you say , we need to have some gimmick , so something like if you lose it and you can whistle , those things ? the the keyrings , . because we always lose our remote control . being as marketing exper expert will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? what are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ?
the the keyrings , . because we always lose our remote control . being as marketing exper expert will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? what are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? what speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . so before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like and apart from this , it should be having good look also , because people really li like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their c_d_ player , m_p_ three player like any electronic devices . they really want to have something good , having good design in their hands , so , yes , all this . what do we think what do we think good size would be for this ? so , we're looking for . we're , carry on .
so , we're looking for . we're , carry on . 'cause know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like hundred buttons on it , or you could have really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . then you lose it , . more like p_d_a_ , just hand held , like , 'cause . for for remember we're trying to make it for twelve euros fifty . no , wasn't , no wasn't thinking of the screen of like p_d_a_ but . we'll have to i'll we're having another meeting in half an hour so we should all look into bit , actually , no , we'll allocate . so you do the looking around at other remote controls . if you could come up with shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into how how it's made i_e_ like how you make it all in one , how what materials are available to you whatever .
and you look at competition and design . so we have . and no doubt we'll get . we'll get warnings for next meetings as . shall 't imagine these are worth much . fashion into electronic .
it's inspired design . there we go , just screw on in . gonna have to swap them round so now , it was function eight . so , after that ? that's the wee blue one . blue one eight . should do it , good one . me again , rajan the marketing expert . as we have decided in the last meeting that have to find out , , . hold on , .
press five to start it first . then the methodology adopted to find out all this was market survey . detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . and what we got was , we found that if you , what they what problems they are having with different remote controls available in the market . seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . they are not so good looking . so , we have to put stress on this , we have to take care of this fact also like our design , should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . and yes that's wi this will definitely , this can definitely put enhance our sales . and even the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high pay more for this good looking remote controls also . so even if the available market goes for the available even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros , which which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have good better better look designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these remote controls .
or is are you coming on to that ? look all the market potential , what how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . so these percentages are are what ? these are different age group persons like , open it in another way . if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in remote control or not , we can find that they up to thirty five years age group we have very good disliking for this this point , like for speech recognition in remote control . so we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from fifteen to thirty five , and and that most of the users of the rem t_v_ are belong to this age group . so we should look . we're als we we're looking at who buys it as . we can look at that that factor also , so yes . which the twenty five to thirty five is usual , .
, that's , . we have to take that out . so we do . fun and games . if the cable's gonna be long enough . kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as . brian , this one also . turn my computer quickly if that's . very much brian . if you want me to help , .
five and escape'll bring it back and just the left button for advancing . so i'm the interface design designer , user interface designer , i'm concerned with what effect the apparatus should have on the user and i'm i'm also want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , so we as company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's big concern of ours . and how do press just the next button ? just left left mouse button . so looked at existing designs and also the information that raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main buyers of of our t_v_ . so what they like and what they find fashionable . and ergonomics , we said , haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , but that comes up , . that can come under arlo as . and the findings , the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set .
if you if you escape then you can see your bar . haven't got my glasses on so hope it's this one . these are two leading remote controls at the moment . they're grey , they've this one's got loads of buttons , it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , and they don't look very exciting . personally prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's bit more sleek with more of this silver , , but there you go , that's what we're up against , and we can do much better than that . we hope so . five , , . we need to the ergonomics is quite important , . particularly if we've there was bit in raj's about r_s_i_ and things as . and not too edgy and like box , more hand-held more not as computery and or organic , , more organic shape .
or if is that function we want in the remote ? haven't been able to , or some voice . do you have trouble whistling ? don't , but know lot of people do . it just it has to be certain whistle too , ? suppose that's true . suppo you could you could have the you could have the instead of whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , , where are you ? that's costly though . much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping , shouting , , and then , what would the response be ? it beeps back at you ?
don't , but know lot of people do . it just it has to be certain whistle too , ? suppose that's true . suppo you could you could have the you could have the instead of whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , , where are you ? that's costly though . much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping , shouting , , and then , what would the response be ? it beeps back at you ? let me set this up . so plug it in , press five ? function eight for the the .

that's costly though . much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping , shouting , , and then , what would the response be ? it beeps back at you ? let me set this up . so plug it in , press five ? function eight for the the . or function eight ? you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . it's just to lock it in . it's got it .
function eight for the the . or function eight ? you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . it's just to lock it in . it's got it . so as the industrial designer my job is to take an input from you , so it's good you went first , and jotted down some notes as to what are the needs and what novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . let's remember that . so raj told us that consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and he also mentioned that the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . lot of the buttons aren't used , and he mentioned that they're not fun to use . and novel feature which we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be little microphone on it , and any noise over certain threshold it'll pick up as distress signal from you and it'll beep back and say here am of this sort .
you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . it's just to lock it in . it's got it . so as the industrial designer my job is to take an input from you , so it's good you went first , and jotted down some notes as to what are the needs and what novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . let's remember that . so raj told us that consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and he also mentioned that the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . lot of the buttons aren't used , and he mentioned that they're not fun to use . and novel feature which we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be little microphone on it , and any noise over certain threshold it'll pick up as distress signal from you and it'll beep back and say here am of this sort . but surely that would have to be specific rather than above threshold 'cause if you had loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . , that's true .
or little base station , . , we could do that too . hadn't thought of that . that might cost more though , 'cause with batteries we don't need to provide , provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries . if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just lead with self connecting brake in it , so don't t'd up up the price that much . battery in it , kinda . so so the unirs the user interface the canonical user interface for these would be just bunch of buttons , but since we're cutting edge company , we will have alternatives like speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product . and lastly the transmission interface is , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . so here's , schematic that my apprentice designer gave me . as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and it's got little operating procedure that looks something like that .
glow in the dark material was thinking . so that would be cheaper than light . may say something about ? actually it's really really very important point as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . but are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . often lost was that , . but if we add speech recognition as as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , like if they come and speak something at the remote control replies to something something and it glows in the dark . both these factors both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , and this will definitely enhance our market sales , so we should take it into consideration also . speech recognition take it don't , i've know of no products that use speech recognition . it's they're act there there was remote control that came out two years ago that had some basic speech recognition on it .
that's the only thing , . but , then you have like the little se separate module by the t_v_ speaker which , and then the remote control would know what's being produced by the television . that we should just stick on , . that comes with our remote control . and that's basic r_f_ frequency so it'll be cheap . that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . if you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . you just say , whatever you whatever you want the remote for , to change the channel or to turn the t_v_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within , within hearing range . and it could be somewhere in the room that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . that could also be built into the t_v_ though , which might make our remote control bit obsolete .
we're getting lot of features now , . the find the finder things it's could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . consideration too is that these remotes get abused lot , they get thrown around , there's good chance the the t_f_t_ screen would break or get damaged . they're pretty fragile . so is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs t_f_t_ screen ? no , that was going on ravs raj's marketing research . so we'll stick with programmability for the buttons that we do have . so that's included in your sub-module , you were finding out about teletext . if you could find out that we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as bit of expensive , no ? it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi .
no , that was going on ravs raj's marketing research . so we'll stick with programmability for the buttons that we do have . so that's included in your sub-module , you were finding out about teletext . if you could find out that we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as bit of expensive , no ? it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi . no it's it's much cheaper than the t_f_t_ , it's just microphone and some some integrated circuits . is it not the circuits that cost , . and it'd it'd be small vocabulary speech recognition system , like . that takes back the r_f_ the r_f_ remote idea as . votes , let's vote .
it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi . no it's it's much cheaper than the t_f_t_ , it's just microphone and some some integrated circuits . is it not the circuits that cost , . and it'd it'd be small vocabulary speech recognition system , like . that takes back the r_f_ the r_f_ remote idea as . votes , let's vote . who wants t_f_t_ ? excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , ? speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . if it's not too expensive it's good gimmick .
speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . if it's not too expensive it's good gimmick . and what else was ing of that haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , programmability . glow in dark . and also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the slogan . can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as . so , it just helps me summarize them . and i'll put any i'm i'm putting anything do in there anyway , so pro project documents . and where is it ? on a_m_i_ scenario controller .
then , lunchtime , yay . that felt bit more like something with order and and reason to it than the last one . this is quite fun actually . really don't , . has anybody pressed , it vibrates . you've your first page . was just writing really big . got small writing . i've been using up the pages . don't wanna waste it .
no , don't . then we shall start with presentation from raj . hi , me raj , again . in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . so we have to look on this . first of all methodology . the met methodology to find out the trend was incl was done in way we have done rec not only recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also factor which will affect our sales and profit . so what are our findings ? in our in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that people people do have preference for tho fancy mobi remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having functional look and feel good . so this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls .
no the first one is the the outlook of the mobile , the it should have fancy outlook , the fancy design rather than just having functional look and feel good , it should have fancy look and foo feel good . the second most important aspect is that remote control should be technologically innovative . we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo remote controls are . so it should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . so that indicates our technological advancement . and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated like this way . and it should be and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . so that they could know how to use these remote controls . when we did fashions , recent fashion our recent fashion update shows that ? was just reading fruit and vegetables .
was just reading fruit and vegetables . hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . we have to , because you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , becoming . we should make big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow . that's very good . so something like that we we should do . and people the feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having plastic look , hard look . that's what we predicted anyway . so so that they could play with it while handi while handling it . so that should also be taken into consideration .
we didn't find out any such point . or was it just . yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so . what is it ? no , it's got it's got it . and then five , ? so the interface concept . the interface specification , what people how they interact with it , . so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what's good about them , what's bad about them , looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , so bit of imagination .
no just escape should . or just escape , . still haven't got my glasses on . so these are the some of the pictures of existing ones . i'll just walk you through them . this one is voice recognition . and that's the idea we're going for . looks pretty complicated . there's an thing , which we thought could could get bit confusing and bit expensive as for us . this one is got scroll like mouse , which .
that's bit exactly . then blind don't watch t_v_ . no they do , they do . they listen to it . and this one is just pointing out . like some of these things the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out that this one the volume it is pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . so that could that's bit confusing . but the buttons on this are it's just showing you how you can have different different buttons . they don't have to be all the same . so that's quite .
but in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want fancy look , they want some new design , something new . but our budget , we've . it's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , . so even if we increase our cost little bit , within some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as as new design with fancy outlook , we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have good sales in the market . i'm not if the if for twenty five euros per twelve euros fifty manufacturing cost , . 't see tha although , to be to be they have got they are going crazy with the technology now , so that you've got your t_v_s and everything so the small but like the black and white , , it just doesn't look funky enough . but , , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour screens , ju wouldn't know about the costs of them . but price price not withstanding , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? and the it will be easy because there will be , on screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click , whatever they wa . that's the thing , because .
that's true , . and one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so i'm not about the . it's it's , it's good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , . child-friendly , this was good , as you pointed out the the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's good shape and the organic is we could make vegetabley round shape , . we could make . know , carrot . si since we're going for the the the company colours , your lemon wasn't that far and if it doesn't work , we've just made lemon . the the lemon . what are the options ? but we don't want it to be .
this remote costs nothing , . so that takes signals from the buttons and translates it into sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the to the l_e_d_ light , which kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , and that sends out the infrared light signal to the television . here it is . so this is the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the no , this is very old one , so now with the new technology this is minimally small and cheap thing to make . so can we make them to any size we like or is there minimum or ? they gotta be almost key-ring . so this is what we need to have for certain . so , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , , what's it gonna be , the board we have to use the same set-up , processor , we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . so for the casing , this an e-mail got from our manufacturing team , , we have bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , latex , double-curved , curved . so lots of choices , what do we think ?
like the rubber , the stress balls , , , that could be bit of gimmick like it's good to hold and . what that is . so something with give to it . and that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . and and the colour is yellow , ? yellow incorporated , . or at least incorporating , . forgot we're what other standard silver other parts or . the buttons like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or if we're having buttons actually , don . so yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ?
yellow incorporated , . or at least incorporating , . forgot we're what other standard silver other parts or . the buttons like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or if we're having buttons actually , don . so yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ? quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . so multi-coloured buttons . you do have ones like play could be green or on and off is red , and like that , . or limit even just limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . makes it easy to use .
quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . so multi-coloured buttons . you do have ones like play could be green or on and off is red , and like that , . or limit even just limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . makes it easy to use . that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish . although this also comes to shape as . if we are gonna make it novel double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , bit comfier , . so the shape we wanna go how exactly ? double what about banana ?
, like , . and lemon might be little hard to grip . but then how would you point it ? how would you point it ? it doesn't matter which end you point , . we could have little l_e_d_s on each end . they only cost pennies . appreciate this idea , because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . that what our data shows that , so this this the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , like people now spongy . i'm i'm not about the banana idea .
then only we can relate it with something . we can relate it by advertising or . so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have public survey , let the public choose what they want . there's good man . there's good idea . , since you're the marketing guy . we'll , we could do that . will be happy to do that . and buttons would , did we say ?
or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have public survey , let the public choose what they want . there's good man . there's good idea . , since you're the marketing guy . we'll , we could do that . will be happy to do that . and buttons would , did we say ? different shapes of buttons ? su for the specific functions , , up and down , play , stop . so so buttons .
there's good man . there's good idea . , since you're the marketing guy . we'll , we could do that . will be happy to do that . and buttons would , did we say ? different shapes of buttons ? su for the specific functions , , up and down , play , stop . so so buttons . they've got , , they've got standard intuitive things that are always used .
will be happy to do that . and buttons would , did we say ? different shapes of buttons ? su for the specific functions , , up and down , play , stop . so so buttons . they've got , , they've got standard intuitive things that are always used . just like that . with the scroll-wheel or no ? what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? speech recognition , , so we need microphone presumably .
speech recognition , , so we need microphone presumably . could put the microphone here . there's the microphone . where should put the microphone ? ho wel are we that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? those ideas saw were just for inspiration , . glad , we're not doing this for real . no i'm not . can do some user test with scroll-wheels , ? and if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone would put it sub-centrally , so it's .
those ideas saw were just for inspiration , . glad , we're not doing this for real . no i'm not . can do some user test with scroll-wheels , ? and if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone would put it sub-centrally , so it's . so should the microphone be just anywhere on it or there's the mic . so it can be held and we really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . so let's not use the whiteboard any more . and so what else was there ? the what about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ?
no i'm not . can do some user test with scroll-wheels , ? and if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone would put it sub-centrally , so it's . so should the microphone be just anywhere on it or there's the mic . so it can be held and we really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . so let's not use the whiteboard any more . and so what else was there ? the what about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? are we just gonna leave that ? still like it .
then you put it in the fruit bowl ? , and then you just tal like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . they can work from you don't have to hold it . it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , they have fruits all round them . make them make them think of fruit , . now just make they don't eat the remote . some like think of fruit that could sit independently on its own like , , an apple . do we need buttons ? then it's just apple so , yellow apples though . quite like the shape .
, and then you just tal like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . they can work from you don't have to hold it . it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , they have fruits all round them . make them make them think of fruit , . now just make they don't eat the remote . some like think of fruit that could sit independently on its own like , , an apple . do we need buttons ? then it's just apple so , yellow apples though . quite like the shape . quite like the design of that , 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got quite steady base .
button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . you can standardise those , . that's the other side . buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the , not not the upper side . so from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . so in that way we need not to have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . tho if you're gonna have facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . it doesn't really 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , unless you have you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with microphone so that you can place it face down . and you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the . so , we decided on material , ?
so you've narrowed it down to half dozen options . so that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , and the colours we got down , and the shape , we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or . because , i'm not if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because we should just take the inspiration from the fruit and because what , wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as they said . so we stick with what we've got there . they wanted something that looks fancy and fruit could be bit of too much of gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going bit gaudy with the yellow , . we could make it pale yellow . it's gotta be our company's yellow . so again like we could have , , we could quite easily have the the main body be different colour , but have kinda going round , . we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . even if not necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colour , so blue and yellow tend to go to we together .
you shake it and scream at it . it is , . because then people have to , like if the cell is out of bat , to mo . it does leave them with an obligation to especially if they want to use it sp specifically as voice activated . because most of the people . then if it's just sitting on the , . then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then . what are the other options ? there's solar power . solar power will also not be good idea , because then they have to keep their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight .
there's solar power . solar power will also not be good idea , because then they have to keep their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight . i'm i'm with raj on that , , , i've got i've got no i've got north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . so probably just . but like just normal light ? we should rechargeable battery will be good idea . they can they can recharge it . that idea that just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that bother is having , , having rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as stand , but for using it as recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . and we're very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as ? like like hand like one of those portable phones thing .
mine seems to have turned off . 't do anything . and touch the pad . it's actually shut down . it's on , but there's nothing on the screen . now what we have our next meeting's in half an hour and what would like you to do is work on giving me model in clay . try flipping the screen down . get to do it , too . so , , luckily we chose simple shape . and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches .
hope recover this , 'cause i've accidentally deleted it . which doesn't really help me much . i've saved mine already . can you save that send that last one again , , raj , as still can't find it on the . it was under different name . will show you , in shared documents . you didn't get that . will send new . i'll put it in shared documents , again . project , project documents .
excuse me , brian . we're almost done , . you have to keep your pen separate , because used your pen . still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and . so we came up with that , that's . shoulda something like that . if kn see knew that . shoulda engineered it so we ended up making diffi difficult shape . just for cruelty . wonder if they mean like literally make it , buttons and everything .
we can do buttons . or we are going to discuss something ? no , that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions , 'cause i'm confused . no i'm good . we'll probably get questionnaire in minute , it's there we go . warning , finish meeting now . rounded it up far too fast . where are we going ? my documents , that's not what want . my project documents .
no , that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions , 'cause i'm confused . no i'm good . we'll probably get questionnaire in minute , it's there we go . warning , finish meeting now . rounded it up far too fast . where are we going ? my documents , that's not what want . my project documents . there we go .
we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you . one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st look . don't recall tomato .
there's good news ? we have budget problems . i'm afraid you're all sacked . don't even have this on . have you got presentation to make ? no , not mine yet . so it's just your your show . we should bring so that the camera can see . we made three for you . one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st look .
there we go . why is it doing that ? there we go . so , in order to save our two euros was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . more like traditional remote control . it's already got shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved in and out . and by doing so no , hold on . doesn't save us quite as much . what's going on with this again . why is the double curved two of them ?
that's curve in and out . this is double-curve . it this one is single curve . 'cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides . no , it means double curved as in like single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . like an shape . might be wrong though . like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . don't think that counts as curve , that's just shape . curvature is like the this case .
no that's fine . we've worked out what it would be anyway . did you try both shift buttons ? it could be the other side . that's too bad . so that's finances and what we what could we reckon we could add ? suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . we could add something , but if what do you we're trying to save money , so . if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . but if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , , feel free to add it .
it could be the other side . that's too bad . so that's finances and what we what could we reckon we could add ? suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . we could add something , but if what do you we're trying to save money , so . if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . but if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , , feel free to add it . it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place now . that's that's , so project evaluation . we have under twelve euros fifty .
are we happy ? we have winning product . we've been writing this up for months . it went quite smoothly . room for creativity , were we happy with that ? we were very creative . no , mea it means individually . yes , no , ? so we're just gonna . you're all get you're all getting raise .
we were very creative . no , mea it means individually . yes , no , ? so we're just gonna . you're all get you're all getting raise . everyone got enough input , . and means , . the technical was brilliant . let's buy more . what , new ideas found , means , to be honest .
the user requirem . do we have the the marker for the board ? there it is . so these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . first of all comes user requirement . so we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . will first would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? it had all the basic buttons that they needed as as the new technology that people said they wanted . so what do you think you will personally give . when the user requirement is essentially just to operate the t_v_ , so , we haven't actually got working model yet .
there it is . so these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . first of all comes user requirement . so we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . will first would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? it had all the basic buttons that they needed as as the new technology that people said they wanted . so what do you think you will personally give . when the user requirement is essentially just to operate the t_v_ , so , we haven't actually got working model yet . does it work ? would say seven .
it's hard to know . give it two . you can you can tell on on the like she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our interface expert . but you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? it might even exceed it . but there is shortage of buttons . i'm gonna give it two . and what about you , brian ? you will go for one . basic requirements but of the pro of the project .
no , personally as marketing expert don't believe that , because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give range of products , range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give variety of different things . some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . so you can what shape person will like . so in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . and by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . but in electronics , , it's not always quite so you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . , if you're going to buy t_v_ company'll have that you're going to choose from , company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . we were coming up with one product . but will will personally won't give it beyond three . no , your opinion , i'm just trying to .
, we are taking everything , and that's have taken it very wrongly . so seven fourths . three four four two six seven seven sev one pe exactly . about one point one point eight . so we can say one or two . because it is one point eight two , so we will do two . round it up to two . so where were the trends . can you explain what you want us to write there ? how it how conforms to the current trends ?
again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the as fruit shape . going on the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , would give it , , because it's hard to make fruit good to look at , that that looks , , so would actually give it three . tha three or four , i'm not . go for three . as far as the technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . so give it four . i'd give it kinda middle of the road for for technology . am pret just the fruit does me in , it might it might be trendy to some , but i'm just not swallowing the fruit , so also would have liked to have seen the screen in it . so i'd say about four as . personally wi that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them .
the company strategy , . there was lot of discussing , that was good . feel got my say . so i'd give the company strategy two . it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . is that the question ? so one or two . just leave it , it's fine . i'll go with two . so what about you , brian ?
so one or two . just leave it , it's fine . i'll go with two . so what about you , brian ? kept to the company strategy , so would go for one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by , groovy . and me also , like , this product me me me this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . so since our product meets all these requirements , so would also prefer to give it rank one . so four six six half . so one and half . so we can say two or one .
is it just more detail , as understand it ? it we're talking the the functional design is more your area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that thing . how how it will be done . so whe where do we identify the components of our product ? it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then . so that's just brief overview of the the the project itself . what i'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . so each person in turn , i'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . why are you looking at me ?
am the need my notebook , top banana . , am the marketing expert so like i'm gonna be doing the according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user requirements specification of the functional design , trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design so . and more about yourself , you're from ? i'm from leicester , second year . what else do you want to know ? like sports , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning and not with rabbits , no no . but not with rabbits . and vets , like vets as . and and like cocktails , especially pink ones . excellent , to match the rabbit .
it looks very very cute . like the cow . like dogs too , but 't do that already because 't draw dog as as you can . is that lizard ? is there difference ? is ar are they also like lizards or are they , they are . they're , they're it's lizard . and like geckos because they remind me of warm places and , and where was living in cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . hope you don't like snakes , do you ? don't like snakes .
is ar are they also like lizards or are they , they are . they're , they're it's lizard . and like geckos because they remind me of warm places and , and where was living in cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . hope you don't like snakes , do you ? don't like snakes . come from australia and we have nasty snakes . that's where i'm from , australia . i'm from melbourne and i'm your project manager for today and my role is to keep things going and make that you all work together in productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with product . so , let's see what's next in the powerpoint presentation . so , i've just thought i've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go .
don't like snakes . come from australia and we have nasty snakes . that's where i'm from , australia . i'm from melbourne and i'm your project manager for today and my role is to keep things going and make that you all work together in productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with product . so , let's see what's next in the powerpoint presentation . so , i've just thought i've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go . if you click on it you can , was looking at the website , and the other things that they've made and like put down some like inspirational words like that got from looking at the pictures . so this is the overall budget for our project . we've got we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each .
i'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . that's probably something that it's best if we take away with us , but if we all have think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . in the beginning one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be trendy , user friendly and original so your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . something something new . so the motto is we put the fashion in electronics and so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , ? so i'm thinking , like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and like that . so something heading towards that , so it's not overly what most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so figure how many do you need , ? so perhaps some menu-based thing , or . something that's little less crowded than this , like , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your t_v_ , ? but what do most people do ?
so perhaps some menu-based thing , or . something that's little less crowded than this , like , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your t_v_ , ? but what do most people do ? they turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , , and then they turn it off again . there is lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , but will be used ten percent of the time , . sometimes they play movie . so there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , to do . so , no . it could be one button for menu , if you really need to go and do that . and then use the .
yes , so . i'll do that next time . i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then i'll send them to you after the meeting . the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . sent at the last minute , i'm about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . the last minute , , . and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . and we've got forty minutes to do that in . so would say ?
project project documents , , , , . project documents , . so i'll put it in there . is it best if send you an email , to let it's there ? yes , so . i'll do that next time . i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then i'll send them to you after the meeting . the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . sent at the last minute , i'm about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing .
as who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , . so we need to , we need to have fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions of the dem remote control itself . so with that it's best if hand over to you . does anyone have preference for going first ? go first , . you wanna go first ? so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours . assume we just pull it out ? so from the . just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ?
go first , . you wanna go first ? so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours . assume we just pull it out ? so from the . just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , just so that don't have to scribble everything down . , afterwards , , . so with with regard to the working design of this remote control i've identified few basic components of the remote and se from the design , functional design perspective we can now know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . so this is the method that i'll mostly be following in my in my role .
once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , just so that don't have to scribble everything down . , afterwards , , . so with with regard to the working design of this remote control i've identified few basic components of the remote and se from the design , functional design perspective we can now know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . so this is the method that i'll mostly be following in my in my role . the identification of the components , and since since i'm dealing only with the technical aspects , would need feedback from the marketing person and from the user interface person . we'll then integrate this into the product design at technical level and update and come up with new design , so it's cyclical process . so these were the basic findings from today . the last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email . quickly jotted them down . so the as told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other .
am going in the direction ? here it comes . i'm getting hungry . here you are . that's why it won't meet . we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here . try to press , , . is it plugged in prop it's working ? so what have , wh where i've got my information from is survey where the usability lab observed remote control use with hundred subjects and then they gave them questionnaire . so it was all about , , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , .
but where's it go ? liked the , liked the litt come back . i'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing . so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . what you can't see is volume selection , it's little bit higher than all the others . that's the next one along , ? so what the graph shows is that , , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like their importance , , so on scale of one to ten , how important is that and , , channel selection and volume selection are essential , and the power , t's not quite so essential , , although don't understand how it couldn't be , and everything else , , , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . this is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . so , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . that they get lost , that the , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury .
so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so we need to aim for both . then long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and , , was thinking that solar power would be quite because , , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment bit . and then like locator , so , like you have for mobile phone or not mobile phone , that's it , . some ring , some . keys and things like that , . whistle and it screams at you , . know , it's weird . my flatmate and were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and was like need to get one for everything . so , so something where you clap and then it beeps , something sound that you don't often hear on the t_v_ , , 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window . that's you , excellent .
but you don't have much money , generally . you share television that . would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their toys and it's on , we unplugged it . but still , if if you can go back to that slide and , how popular was it ? i've unplugged it . do you want me to . here , let me . that's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh people between twenty five to thirty five , how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . seventy six point three percent . it was seventy something , , .
i've unplugged it . do you want me to . here , let me . that's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh people between twenty five to thirty five , how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . seventy six point three percent . it was seventy something , , . so even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ? kn you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , but it has been proven that that people of that age group have higher disposable income because they don't have like , , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , but you don't have mortgage , you don't have life insurance policy , you don't normally have car , , so . they've got no commitments and usually not car and all of those things . you're still learning to drive actually , so that just costs more than car , but .
, many people without t_v_ . this this is not unaffordable , but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have t_v_ to use its full . but do they but the t_v_s are often someone's old t_v_ that's blah blah and be bit strange to have fancy rome remote . we didn't have t_v_ last year , and everyone thought we were off our heads , . common , the students , . the the stu , and the remote control might not , it might not even function with the old t_v_ . 've we've got quite decent t_v_ . bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , ? so are are are . or we can just , but at the same time we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , because actually they're all still re young people .
you do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? because you have like every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . but how frequently do we use it anyway and ho how good is it , voice recognition softwares are still quite . with but with t_v_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , louder , tha that should be relatively simple . so you'd need code word . so like when you say change , except that's being said quite lot on t_v_ , so like , , remote . how often do people say remote on t_v_ ? although only watch charmed , so really wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five , , remote ten , remote one two nine . so it seems like feasible thing to implement for for limited . but if you wanna look into that just to just to check .
so that you can yell at it , . , so you have to have the remote control . it's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , . but then the remote control the idea is it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep near yourself . , suppose nearer to you but like if you have surround sound then . and it might become very difficult from distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl it'll it'll . no , but was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , and not to yell at it from the distance . so wh another thing that can be used is that there can be beeper button on the t_v_ , so you can go and press that button and and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is . that's but then if you're buying the remote separately , but you could have something , but if it was something that you could like stick onto the t_v_ , some like two if you bought it in two part pack , so one part attaches to the t_v_ . 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control .
that would be . so so we'll just put them there , we we , we won't even . put them in there . then you don't have to email them . there you go . but is everyone's called functional requirements ? no , they're all called something slightly different . technical requirements and something something , . so that's good . that's me done .
no , they're all called something slightly different . technical requirements and something something , . so that's good . that's me done . so , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . whatever that means . i'll find out . you'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map that we'll keep keep our options op ? something conceptual , .
something conceptual , . wha what was it again that was supposed to look into ? con components , . but the next meeting are we going to have it after lunch or shall we prepare our to prepare , , , that's good . no , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , so that's fine , before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some summary . so you can we'll see you for lunch in sec ?
you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , , . did you say wool ? wood , wood . you'll understand why when we get to my presenta . the so we can use even certain titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment , so it's it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but it cannot be used on double curved surface . if we choose this , we cannot use titanium . for for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic . the interface options now . so we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . we can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointers , , something like that .
wood , wood . you'll understand why when we get to my presenta . the so we can use even certain titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment , so it's it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but it cannot be used on double curved surface . if we choose this , we cannot use titanium . for for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic . the interface options now . so we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . we can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointers , , something like that . sony ericsson mobile phones has it . so , and they have they can even have an an integrated push-button inside the scrolling thing .
no it's got its little camera in there , plug it in . it should should do it . to be honest actually , mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk this time , mentioned them already in the previous talk . so , this time might not have them on the slides but just mention them aw again . so would also include the definition of user interface so it's the aspects of of of computer system or programme which can be seen by the user and and which the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . so this would includes things like shape and size and buttons and voice recognition as , and colour , and so on . the method employed this time was again having look to related products and mainly on the internet and then analyse them from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also whether their appearance was was pleasant . and then this this this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . so some findings . so in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually hard to find the ones you you really want to use and and it's just confusing , it takes know time to learn .
are , the ipod thing , . it's like the like you said , no ? the scroll scroll wheel . you can't , it's like the ipod . no no , the scroll button is different thing . have picture if you just moment , i'll i'll show you . wasn't completely myself , but it's just like it's it's wheel , it's like not separate buttons . look , this one here . but i'm i'm not really whether whether you can really turn it round , it's like you press this or this or . no , you can .
the scroll scroll wheel . you can't , it's like the ipod . no no , the scroll button is different thing . have picture if you just moment , i'll i'll show you . wasn't completely myself , but it's just like it's it's wheel , it's like not separate buttons . look , this one here . but i'm i'm not really whether whether you can really turn it round , it's like you press this or this or . no , you can . it's the ipod alright , . it's like it's like where you how you have your your mouse , and you go round and it's like that and you spin round and it .
that's over on the interface , if if you could put . and the and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing . have point about , if it is the point to take it up . l_c_d_s are for feedback , , to the user who's pressing buttons , and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an on the remote ? depends how fast your television runs , really , don't don't you think ? we've got one of those telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you and then it goes to the t_v_ and then you , and then it comes , so it actually takes quite long time . and if you get the number in wrong , then it's bit of pain , so , , screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . but like remotes do tend to get thrown about bit . it it is also quite though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , so if you're watching something . that's true , , that's also .
no , don't makes lot of difference . have one of those slidey phones and the back is essentially straight , but it's curvy , so . besides , you have four sides to thing , so does curved one side mean one side is straight and , curved two sides means the whole thing is just big curvy thing ? di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding because according to the information that have , the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three . eith either we have flat surfaced case or curved surfaced case . it does not say anything about whether technically , , this this is available . nothing to open them . it's it's more about the protecting the , which is where it came from . but no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , 'cause had nothing better to do with my time . what've we got ?
di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding because according to the information that have , the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three . eith either we have flat surfaced case or curved surfaced case . it does not say anything about whether technically , , this this is available . nothing to open them . it's it's more about the protecting the , which is where it came from . but no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , 'cause had nothing better to do with my time . what've we got ? combine style with level of functionality , beauty and practicality and thing of beauty and function . looking at what we've got , we we want an display with spinning wheel . let's let's try to rub off things and , so hand dynamos are definitely out , ?
combine style with level of functionality , beauty and practicality and thing of beauty and function . looking at what we've got , we we want an display with spinning wheel . let's let's try to rub off things and , so hand dynamos are definitely out , ? rub off some of those . you you got wind dynamo , . it's not that's not streamlined and sexy , having having wind up . kinetic energy does seem to have some appeal , but it's . tha depends how much how much movement it really needs . it's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? as against watch , which constantly keeps moving , this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user .
rub off some of those . you you got wind dynamo , . it's not that's not streamlined and sexy , having having wind up . kinetic energy does seem to have some appeal , but it's . tha depends how much how much movement it really needs . it's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? as against watch , which constantly keeps moving , this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user . if 't imagine wooden remote control . kinetic energy it needs don't have too much technical information on that , , . pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it .
as against watch , which constantly keeps moving , this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user . if 't imagine wooden remote control . kinetic energy it needs don't have too much technical information on that , , . pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it . let's keep it option keep an option , . i'd i'd keep it on . the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , ? we don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable . it has to be at least curved from one side , . we still have all all the options .
or do we have just channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ? no , no , we we definitely need the the numbers , because it's otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels . do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as ? would say buttons , because it's . or on the we can , . would think buttons , . it's it's the the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their t_v_ and put on channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , , change the contrast on their t_v_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , but , , most of the time there's limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the t_v_ , is the the the issue there . so buttons definitely in but shall we try to draw prec . that's what you are gonna do next , so if we put down the key things that we want . , so the components .
would say buttons , because it's . or on the we can , . would think buttons , . it's it's the the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their t_v_ and put on channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , , change the contrast on their t_v_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , but , , most of the time there's limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the t_v_ , is the the the issue there . so buttons definitely in but shall we try to draw prec . that's what you are gonna do next , so if we put down the key things that we want . , so the components . so what about the the scrolling ? but i'm not completely completely clear , about the spinning wheel . so it it doesn't make sense to have both like scrolling and spinning thing , it's you can al include everything in the spinning if you , , in that case .
but i'm not completely completely clear , about the spinning wheel . so it it doesn't make sense to have both like scrolling and spinning thing , it's you can al include everything in the spinning if you , , in that case . just spinning and not scrolling , would say . would say the the the spinning goes at high speed to to the scrolling wheel , so you have to decide whether you , you want to be going so fast or not . but the the thing with this whole if you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then i'm not how scrolling wheel would work . i'm not it'll be good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . but if you've got if if you've got flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . but you can , so too , the case would be the case would be rubber and the the buttons , rubber buttons , but then . but your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . that would be on one side , .
now i've gone too far . we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as as l_c_d_s , . we're on our way . so we've worked out that we're going with simple battery , the advanced chip and curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber . we're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . that's our overall concept , and it's gonna look vegetable , and be in bright vegetable colours . so would with have the spinning wheel inside with the , or would it be on the outer . it's on the . imagine it would be inside . so actually that could like really cut down your thing , so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got screen and spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into .
about four fifteen , . until about four fifteen . go for it . do you want yes . so , you said are are we starting with the the so will you start with like the the shape and things and and then will explain the the user interface things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and , but it's it's just an approximation . so going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . you think bananas are safe thing to use ? it's bit phallic . dual use , perfect . dual use , perfect .
that's just bad . does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? so it's the it's the flip open thing again . so now we we have the , so ma maarika will explain you the user interface there . and it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . and we have the user interface in here and the the and and the scroll are inside . everything else is probably user interface , so . and it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that . it has , . is it to scale , or do you think you can make it bit smaller ?
so it's the it's the flip open thing again . so now we we have the , so ma maarika will explain you the user interface there . and it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . and we have the user interface in here and the the and and the scroll are inside . everything else is probably user interface , so . and it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that . it has , . is it to scale , or do you think you can make it bit smaller ? it could be made bit smaller , and and it would be and , but one thing we actually forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , so we said the back side round , . , but since it's made of rubber anyway .
it could be made bit smaller , and and it would be and , but one thing we actually forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , so we said the back side round , . , but since it's made of rubber anyway . it does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so would say that this curvy does look quite like vegetable . and it's spongy as . wasn't very keen on that , but . so so the user interface as as we discussed last time on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . so we have that channels here starting from one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . so it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , zero here . six seven eight nine . and then , this is on off button .
the volume is is scrolling . on the side , this one . it's on the side . you did get that in then , . you just do it like this . and and and it's it's on the back is cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . so the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , , there there you have the screen and and you have the spinning wheel with options to choose . you can move back and forth and then if you need to choose something on the screen , you just push the cen the middle button . the thing we forgot was like mute button . no , we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials .
you can have look . very good , let's have look . test it out . it's intermediate colour , . , we hold the remote . but it it does feel all cold and slimy . hate play-do , it's just minging . but , that's , . so if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there suspect we're gonna have couple of minor finance issues , but we'll se i'm we can get around them somehow . see the budget .
just prepare one now . shall prepare it now ? it will be red , too . so , be attractive to look at . that's this one . what do you all say ? seven was the maximum , ? go for seven . seven , , it's terribly sexy . we're all so proud of the .
go for seven . seven , , it's terribly sexy . we're all so proud of the . so that'll be seven for . could no , you can't whilst that's up there . what i've done on the next page is i've set it up so we just put the marks in . except we can't we can if we then , i'll take note , it's fine . but that's alright . but we can we can take note the the only thing that we were considering was that this thing is more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , so if you're left-handed you're left scrolling with your finger . if you take note of them , and then i'll put them in in minute .
would think yes , . so so we we might do we might want to do like another model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . but that's gonna be problem , 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in family . so bu it's it's not huge problem , because it is operatable . it's not it's not like it's pen . but then then left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , so they just . but because it's not like it's pen , , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , but they can normally do most things right-handed , so would say it's not such big issue . because anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , so if the majority are right-handed , it's or six , because it's just one one one among the issues , . you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . so that does negate the whole r_s_i_ issue .
that you stick on t_v_ . to make it beep . but but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to to do some to make some sounds , so . so that's two , so that's seven , . intuitive , completely intuitive . if if this means intuitive , if it means the way people are used to finding things and it's it's . i'd say six , 'cause the the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . really like the way you have it , but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . and so , should we say five and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do , it's obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first . so might be but it and it's something that they will be experiencing in lot of different places soon .
i'm gonna give seven in everything , so . i'm glad you're accepting this . it has taken little while , hasn't it ? intuitive but , it's really hard to write on those . went bit mad , didn't ? would this comes back from this whole thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . but otherwise it's superb . so , should we give it six ? the ergonom ergonomic design , the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , ? unless you are all the time sitting .
unless you are all the time sitting . so it's kinda . 've banned them from . it is ergonomic . used to send fifty texts day , , and never got repetitive strain injury from that , so find it quite hard to believe to be honest . and moreover it it has and everything , so that we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . so we give that six , . it does have . voice control have seven . hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ?
that's just , . that's the second one . so you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide . so it has voice control . yes , so that's seven then . anyway it ha , it's the most sophisticated remote that ever seen . but in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . we have we have the sample speaker as , which is , it's new . but you don't they're never been used they've never been using remote remote control before don't think . all of the components have been used in other things before .
so , we need the average here , so we got seven so we've got four sevens , so that's twenty eight , three sixes , eighteen . the average is about six and something . little bit over six . there are how many sixes ? no , , little bit under six . one , two , three . and one five . three sixes , , . fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six .
no , , little bit under six . one , two , three . and one five . three sixes , , . fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . forty six and five , fifty one . six point point about six point five . fifty one divided by it'll have to for bit . six point something , .
no , that's it , . so , finance . and we'll see if we can unscrew this first . there we go . this is i'm just beautiful . there we go and there are the marks . computer no signal ? there we go . so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . and now we have to calculate the production costs .
anything which is not more . something coloured , , probably . so this is probably special co no ? it could be rub rubber comes coloured , it's would it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? or if you want some pattern thing on it , , . let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . we we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton , and then we've scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? we have pushbuttons , scro we have scroll wheel as .
it could be rub rubber comes coloured , it's would it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? or if you want some pattern thing on it , , . let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . we we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton , and then we've scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? we have pushbuttons , scro we have scroll wheel as . for the muting . , we had , for muting , . no we we have .
we have pushbuttons , scro we have scroll wheel as . for the muting . , we had , for muting , . no we we have . and we have l_c_ display and . and button supplements . but what do we ha we have l_c_ display , but but the wh but the spinning wheel . we don't have we're not using any of that . but the the spinning wheel's not there . have think it's integrated with the l_c_ display ?
if that's one . not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . that seems unlikely . push what whether whether pushbutton means that count by button or do we don't think that makes sense . wh wh what is the limit ? twelve point five . we have to count all of them , or . don't , no . doesn't , but it and l_c_ display . no it says what what is the interface , if it is pushbutton then you got zero point five , it's scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and display , so that's that's the three interfaces that we have .
twelve point five . we have to count all of them , or . don't , no . doesn't , but it and l_c_ display . no it says what what is the interface , if it is pushbutton then you got zero point five , it's scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and display , so that's that's the three interfaces that we have . so , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . wh wh what's our criteria ? this sample sensor . our budget's twelve point five . the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .
we have to count all of them , or . don't , no . doesn't , but it and l_c_ display . no it says what what is the interface , if it is pushbutton then you got zero point five , it's scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and display , so that's that's the three interfaces that we have . so , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . wh wh what's our criteria ? this sample sensor . our budget's twelve point five . the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . so that has implications though for the .
this sample sensor . our budget's twelve point five . the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . so that has implications though for the . it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello . for the locator . but that's bit of gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? and the locator also goes away . we can afford to get rid of it .
and the locator also goes away . we can afford to get rid of it . but it was very no innovative innovativeness . so that means no locator , does it ? what else does it need ? the speaker the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . 'cause the sample speaker was , , more complicated then just beeping thing . this would be , there you record your samples your speech samples and , then then we would be in the budget . , so we . also in the case i'm not that you will evaluate this as curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably flat surface rubber .
no , don't . not really , no . because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep display . we instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . we just got rid of gimmick that was never anyway , and the scroll wheel is essentially the two buttons that was it's not difference don't think . but we lose the locator . we're gonna have beep . 're going to have beeping thing . so instead of speaker , . but , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate .
cover up the microphone . alright , let's take it . but that worked having having whiteboard that we could draw on as as having the powerpoint , 'cause the find that the problem with powerpoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , . it is bit limiting , isn't it ? and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the . the thing flew in , you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so . that's alright , that always irritates me anyway , . not that you can do that on the board , either . we could make some little , , that was fairly tight anyway , especially with that last-minute alteration . but , but already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , .
to express them no . it was fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , . new ideas found . not quite what about . t's it's it's pretty new , pretty novel solution for for remote control really , all this flipping open thing and , neither neither do , but i've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . don't go shopping for remote controls that often , somebody's already though of it . i'll be looking out next time need to write an essay . that looks boring , i'll see if anyone's made remote control . we could have patent on this one . patent patent patent .
and my main difficulty was the the time pressure . otherwise it's it's all fine . , sometimes it's like little bit rushed . that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and . although we could have made the r_s better had we had five more minute . we're still within our time . we've got like five minutes left . we've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . we're just too too efficient and you should never drag meeting on just because you have extra time . we certainly are , .
or put in your pocket , . so my favourite animal , it's big , it's got memory . what's your favourite animal ? is it rude ? it's an elephant . that's very good elephant . the back end of an elephant . my gosh , i'm never gonna be able to draw that . and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your your favourite characteristics of that animal . supposed to have memory , we say an elephant never forgets .
have no idea what my favourite animal is . my favourite animal , let's see . dunno if any of you have seen napoleon dynamite before . it's liger , combination of lion and tiger . have you not seen napoleon dynamite ? it's hilarious movie . you have to see it . and and it's best characteristic is it's the awesomest animal . but you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it . miss mar miss marketing ?
not quite how this is gonna work . 'll try my best to draw . can draw the face ? you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks . that's very pr pretty cat . which also has what ? big fat body and big and long tail . do do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it ? and usually cats are very friendly . and they're healing as .
and usually cats are very friendly . and they're healing as . and they can feel when human's got problems so so , that's why like cats . so they're kinda spiritual . there we are , that's me . don't actually have favourite animal , but for the for for this meeting i'll draw little . honestly can't draw for toffee . that's not bad would say . no no that's exactly what it is . not very good one , , you got it's it's squirrel , and like them , because they're cute and stupid .
we've all got . is this t_v_ one we are supposed to make ? it's t_v_ remote control . but how do we know how much , , how much do we have per how much ? new remote control for t_v_ . what would like ? what you want it big do you want it small . are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going that's that's big and video and ts hi-fi and . it seems like there's like there's tension between two ideas , , you want you want one remote that can work all all of the functions of t_v_ and if you have whatever associated with t_v_ the d_v_d_ player , like that , but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with thousand buttons on it . you now that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap .
it's t_v_ remote control . but how do we know how much , , how much do we have per how much ? new remote control for t_v_ . what would like ? what you want it big do you want it small . are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going that's that's big and video and ts hi-fi and . it seems like there's like there's tension between two ideas , , you want you want one remote that can work all all of the functions of t_v_ and if you have whatever associated with t_v_ the d_v_d_ player , like that , but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with thousand buttons on it . you now that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . 'cause was thinking something that's got different like an display on it that's got different pages for different devices , but that would that would probably be quite expensive . it can't be more than twelve fifty per unit .
are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going that's that's big and video and ts hi-fi and . it seems like there's like there's tension between two ideas , , you want you want one remote that can work all all of the functions of t_v_ and if you have whatever associated with t_v_ the d_v_d_ player , like that , but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with thousand buttons on it . you now that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . 'cause was thinking something that's got different like an display on it that's got different pages for different devices , but that would that would probably be quite expensive . it can't be more than twelve fifty per unit . per unit , . so do we have to be realistic within the budget or close pr how much it would cost . at the moment we could , wa we 'cause we this is what we what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . couldn't we have like one that comes out ? so would be to have something that that controls lots of different things .
industrial designer which is . these are requirement specification . and i'm marketing . there you go . so user interface designer , that's that's that's you , so you gotta you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . industrial designer , you are the one , , you're gonna be working out box it goes in , so , whether it's what goes into the box , somehow . har how it works an bu do you think our two overlap , because . and in marketing user requirements specifications . these are requirement specification . so what the user requires in remote .
think we all . you will as ? we all were . have one too , . whoops forgot to put the thing on . wanna 'cause 't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so wanna rather than going miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again . just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll . that's good idea . so , and gabriel . i'm catherine with c_ .
this meeting it's not very long . it's probably down to about thirty five minutes now . so want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . if you haven't done powerpoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium . if you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can however you want to do your little presentation , , you can . don't feel pressurised into using this thing . you over there ? reissa , are you are you joining in with this meeting here or are or are or are you are you just are you just doing some internet shopping there ? think she's finishing up her presentation . i'm finishing off my presentation .
think she's finishing up her presentation . i'm finishing off my presentation . alright , let's have , we all know that it's it's remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . the first thing we should look at is probably the what it is that it is actually supposed to be . so that's gonna be you catherine , if we wanna hear from you first . just connecting this . are we getting really ? you don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go . so i've got very quick . so the working design , i've got very quick presentation on this , so i've no , you can't see thing .
the thing is you you don't , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . doesn't have to go through wall , because you're not gonna be looking through wall . but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room . didn't think about that but why not ? how about bluetooth ? instead of using infra-red , use bluetooth . isn't that better signal ? think that it's it's gonna cost more and i'm i'm not it's you're gonna use it . it sounds like you you don't wanna overcomplicate things . we don't need it .
we're we're desi we're designing and marketing television remote control unit . we're not designing something that you can plug in headset to and and connect to your laptop computer and . 's just an idea . done , catherine . gab gabriel let's let's hear from you on on on such things . i'm just gonna use the powerpoint . so , while this is warming up , there it is . so i'm doing the user interface design . and , as far as methods , was was looking looking at looking at already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , what we what we can perfect little bit as far as design .
would say it's if it's simple to do , which it probably should be , even if it's physical , , like physical switch or physical cover for the remote , even something like that , then yes , it's like , , like you said earlier on ab ab ab flip thing , something like that , but being physical . i've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred , something we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . it's gotta look like it's in the and . the the company it's it's , from what see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . and our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . we put the fashion in electronics . we have to carry that mental . there you go . so it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and something fashionable . if if remote control , if telephones can be fashionable , then remote control units can be .
repetitive strain rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing . repetitive strains injury , so they don't people who watch t_v_ too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . they shouldn't watch so much t_v_ then . so so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have look into then when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have look if there's any any medical background we can find out about this . not so hard . it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching . let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . we should probably consult with our legal department . they're having lunch break at the moment , but . i'll see if get see if get hold of them for the next meeting .
in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , . it's just participant one . so project manager , it's participant one at a_m_i_ . can you all e-mail me your e-mail addresses ? t's just it's just it's just par participant one , participant two . you have them you have them , but we'll send you an e-mail . send me , , . you want to have friends , don't you ? so are we headed towards like big yellow and black remote as far as that's our next meeting that we discuss that . is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ?
see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . it's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's real reaction product . but if it's r_r_ , it would be real reaction , like if it had symbol on it . there's loads of companies that called r_r_ . this is slog but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type . and this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , so , , we are beholden to them . so we have to have it one colour . not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . but we have to incorporate it . not necessarily even if it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to sony product or , , panasonic product .
we might possibly have done . alright , see you all soon . if we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch . there you go . have to there's few little bits and pieces have to write down , but take your headsets off , kick back , smoke if you got .
we we can hold on for minute . figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . that's the spam that everybody likes to receive . are you ready ? , , take it that you are all ready now . alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and and you have just been off doing some some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . do you have any preference of order ?
i'd like to hear i'd like to hear who's who's on the from from catherine actually first . want what i'd like to hear about is if we've finally decided on what energy we're gonna be using and it's just that , let's let's hear from you first . she is still finishing her . no no no no , it's fine i'm just preparing . where is that thing ? it's is it like crank thing . would that work ? get yourself in position . so that's me again . so for the energy sources we can have basic battery , hand dynamo which is which was used in the fifties for torches , if you remember that which wouldn't be wouldn't be , .
it's is it like crank thing . would that work ? get yourself in position . so that's me again . so for the energy sources we can have basic battery , hand dynamo which is which was used in the fifties for torches , if you remember that which wouldn't be wouldn't be , . don't think any of us remember the fifties . it wouldn't be very fancy . you can have kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . so if you have just bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . or you can use solar cells , but i'm not about that indoors , really , but .
get yourself in position . so that's me again . so for the energy sources we can have basic battery , hand dynamo which is which was used in the fifties for torches , if you remember that which wouldn't be wouldn't be , . don't think any of us remember the fifties . it wouldn't be very fancy . you can have kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . so if you have just bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . or you can use solar cells , but i'm not about that indoors , really , but . there's sometimes combinations , , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from light bulb ?
it has to be on the on the solar energy , but . think the the what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . and if we want something fancier , the kinetic provision of energy could be , but if it's worth the cost . so we've got to discuss that . for the case of the remotes itself , they can be general case , which is just flat one . you can have curved one or double curved one , if what , so , more ergonomic , that suits the palm of your hand , that thing . what's double curved one ? so then the case material itself , so it can be either plastic or latex , rubber , wood , or titanium . and for each of them you have cases where titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing double curved case , we can't choose titanium . and if we are choosing solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account .
but is it double curved one or not ? if it's not double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . if that makes sense . if it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , it doesn't matter if it's double isn't rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? mean so what's the difference between normal rubber case and rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? no , but na le you see , you've got , , the energy that's one thing , then you have the case is , whether it's flat or curved . rubble double double . i'll have big mac , . and that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . so if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved .
no , but na le you see , you've got , , the energy that's one thing , then you have the case is , whether it's flat or curved . rubble double double . i'll have big mac , . and that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . so if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . and i'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go why , but we need to go for rubber push-buttons . so , either we just need to decide on the on the case . let's have rubber push buttons , . go rubber the whole way . let's go crazy .
if if it's not chip on print then , , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . it's less expensive technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . so it sounds so , why would we not go for that ? if it's something that's inside the the unit . fo it doesn't , , , . it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . we wanna go for an all so long as it works , . so let's not go for the , . so let's not let's not bother with the chip on print . so it's either the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .
then then it was when they said when they said , voice recognition , they meant like , channel five , and it will change . just if you are really lonely , . if you're really lonely , it is it's no , tha that that that would be more promising . and then it switches on . like you talk to it . can have channel five ? it it's just remote that talks to you . then forget about it . to certain cues . so i'll go back , , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose .
we were go we were going with the late with the the r_s_i_ rubber , weren't we ? so we want it rub rubber double curved . the the the double whopper , . so it will look like something like this . so then if we use double curved case , then we have to choose rubber push-buttons , and that's fine ? but we're going for the simple buttons . so rubber rubber keys , . and it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as 'cause we were saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that the the people have the people were getting the complaining about r_s_i_ , and this is anti-r_s_i_ . so that's another marketing point that we can use . the rubber push-buttons .
but we're going for the simple buttons . so rubber rubber keys , . and it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as 'cause we were saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that the the people have the people were getting the complaining about r_s_i_ , and this is anti-r_s_i_ . so that's another marketing point that we can use . the rubber push-buttons . don't you have to move your . but anything is gonna have buttons . even if it's jog wheel , it's still repetitive . they would give an option of flat buttons or that they don't . you you see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing button or pressing flat bit of screen .
second , it should be technologically innovative innovative . so technologically it should be like work , , . what's that mean ? it should work . should be it should be cutting edge in some sense , have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . should that's new . now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the that works already , that's cheap . actually , , these first two points we've already gone away from , 'cause our rubber one is not fancy it's different , but wouldn't say like rubber remote is fancy . if that's what people want then we we're going in the wrong direction . and it's it's not technologically innovative either .
it should work . should be it should be cutting edge in some sense , have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . should that's new . now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the that works already , that's cheap . actually , , these first two points we've already gone away from , 'cause our rubber one is not fancy it's different , but wouldn't say like rubber remote is fancy . if that's what people want then we we're going in the wrong direction . and it's it's not technologically innovative either . so , no loose that's why was thinking , bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up bluetooth , and it's like bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , , 'cause bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . we could , they do . they do , but it's like it's not , but it looks good .
if it's rubber it needs to be different . you said earlier on it should be funky . it's it should be , what do you associate with rubber ? like really different colours . keep it clean , keep it clean . sor , used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? like i'm just thinking bright colours . bright natural colours , nothing too bright , but too not . bright , but not too bright . like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink .
and on the back of it have the logo . the one thing i'm wondering about , hope that we're not going like too much down gimmicky road of of having if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then big spongy pink tomato remote . tha , we that's we we . this is the remote control tomato . what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? can say in this country , you'll get , , lots of people wanting something really funky and . like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , mummy wanna buy that one . and parents will see the will see the pro as , because it's like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . especially with younger kids , they can pick it up and and . the only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but .
'cause if you don't , you'll i'm you'll soon get an e-mail about it . we all we need to do now . this gives you all the details ? it's we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish . but got note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just hold hold fire . i'll stay in here . does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that so we're buying fut , we're getting futures in the company . it's , , , it's gonna be par part more of profit sharing on the product . that's that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment . so we really have incentive to make this remote work .
it's we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish . but got note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just hold hold fire . i'll stay in here . does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that so we're buying fut , we're getting futures in the company . it's , , , it's gonna be par part more of profit sharing on the product . that's that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment . so we really have incentive to make this remote work . i'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing . want share in the space rocket . did you see that this that this company we've made spaceship .
let's have your let's get have the presentation ? we've got some . we've got prototype . it's pretty exciting . so , everything that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , , double curved , but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . so if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what thing we have going here . so , , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , , the thumb button is the power button . your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . what's the big blue thing ? that's the lock button , has l_ l_ on it and then the m_ is mute button .
as it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? so what mark should we give for that ? would give it seven . as in it's not . so i'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . second criteria , new technology . have we implemented new technology ? as in the new high-tech so it's . the kinetic thing , . that was our main technological innovation every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .
it's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , , , . so criteria three is is it easy to use ? it's one , . i'd say it's wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not . would give it would give it two , 'cause it it it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but . two , so it's but if we make right-handed and left-handed then ? if we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then would give it one , but otherwise otherwise two . give it give it two . criteria four is costs . it's come in under budget .
contains only the necessary buttons . r_s_i_ is it good against ? so it's anti-r_s_i_ . and criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ? is it easy to get lost ? don't t's gonna get lost easily . it is very bright , . but it is smallish . it's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between couch cushion , . it would , could be , could get lost .
don't t's gonna get lost easily . it is very bright , . but it is smallish . it's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between couch cushion , . it would , could be , could get lost . you could lost . it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say , it's not one , definitely . it no , , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but . it's bigger than the average mobile , . but , , it can get lost .
think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other r_r_ teams , . so , , and we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design . in four diff in in four meetings . funny , all designer meetings could be this quick . this isn't simulation , this is actually so it's like sony or someone like that they're they're just , , they get . they're actually trying to find ideas for ideal remote . they're using our ideas . two years' time this will be on the market . ex exactly that product thum we'll go , , we designed that and no-one will believe us . but no , when this meeting's finished like officially , there we'll get questionnaire to fill in .
or six , haven't got message . just start summarising now . you can reply to the same message . see summary , there . if you just reply to that one . so there's no way to like predict what our 'cause we had we originally had as far as our financial goals , we had specific number for profits that we wanted . it was fifty mil fifty million don't remember . was it was it fifty or five ? but there's not way to compute that , , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ? it gets handed over to another department .
it gets handed over to another department . depends how much we sell . what our what our project was was to come up with the product , . the for the and just is it it come can is it within budget . when it when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , , the the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the , the all the in the profit sharing , . but we have vested interest prof profit sharing . we've we've we've made we've made we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's does everything that we wanted it to do . we finished an hour earlier . it's new , it's it's something that that isn't out there already . actually and one advantage of of this is that after the , , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be remote , .
being all wired up and vibrating pen and it's . your moment to shine . thi , i'd i'd , as we said earlier , i've not never seen that before . something that the whiteboard thingy , that's . but pen with camera on it , don't t's such new thing . it's or in such new idea . it would be different if it was hand writing recognition , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on computer screen as picture file rather than actual text . they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step . we should end this , since we're off off topic .
and i'm the industrial designer on this project . so let's see if get here . will draw little turtle for you all . not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that they're drawable . and you have the pretty little shell going on . some little eyes . there you go . so what are your favourite characteristics ? like the whole having shell thing . it's quite carry your home around where you go , quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , and they're easy to draw .
like the whole having shell thing . it's quite carry your home around where you go , quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , and they're easy to draw . shall we just go around the table ? my name is iain and i'm the user interface designer for the project . and i'll try and draw my favourite animal . i'll should leave that one on there shouldn't before callously rub it off . no , you can erase the turtle , it's alright . might be to have them all up there at same time . i'm not gonna draw it quite to scale . is that at least identifiable ?
my name is iain and i'm the user interface designer for the project . and i'll try and draw my favourite animal . i'll should leave that one on there shouldn't before callously rub it off . no , you can erase the turtle , it's alright . might be to have them all up there at same time . i'm not gonna draw it quite to scale . is that at least identifiable ? it's whale , yes . it's , cat . my , it's better than what i'm gonna be able to do .
it's whale , yes . it's , cat . my , it's better than what i'm gonna be able to do . and , , the reason like whales is 'cause they're , first of all they're quite intelligent and also they're they're mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . and find them interesting animals . take my contraptions with me . alright , i'm jessy . i'm from around d_c_ ish in the u_s_ . and we're gonna keep the deep sea theme going on , animal . don't really know how to draw this .
would imagine all of them , but we could but it's possible we could use like lithium battery that would last lot longer than like double a_s . something that doesn't . like tho those are the batteries that are used in lot of m_p_ three players now and that thing . it seems we have little bit of conflict over to combining all the remotes cont together versus having five different remotes . so like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . so how do we work with that ? could we get something that just has no doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program other things that i'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , volume control , on , off , channel changing . and that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the t_v_ on that's , , like the top thing on the remote , if be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the t_v_ was here , then all the v_c_r_ was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , 'cause then you like , don't even i'm turning on . and if if you'd save the more complicated functions for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . so have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things .
or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? it's good question . i'll look into that . it's just t_v_ , , if it if we're taking it just new product new television remote control that's not like doesn't say . things might be more advanced than that . so we should we should assume that it's just television that we're wanting to control . suppose it would be to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as if that works technologically or not . we have to define what what we're aiming for . if it's just television then that it's bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it . it's an idea with the buttons being really .
yes , yes , . i'll just attach it to an email . and you're you're number two , three , four ? is that correct ? it was lovely meeting you all . just make you keep checking the company web site and the emails . let me see if do that now .
is that possible ? yes , yes , . i'll just attach it to an email . and you're you're number two , three , four ? is that correct ? it was lovely meeting you all . just make you keep checking the company web site and the emails . let me see if do that now .
you might have to disconnect rose . there's wee wee plug just just that one there that's it , . where does it go ? i'm not supposed to move this , but where's function ? and then you have to press function eight it is on your laptop . function , eight , . the blue one , f_n_ . is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and . , 's screw in . you just have to push it in really hard .
how do hook my screen up ? you might have to disconnect rose . there's wee wee plug just just that one there that's it , . where does it go ? i'm not supposed to move this , but where's function ? and then you have to press function eight it is on your laptop . function , eight , . the blue one , f_n_ . is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and . , 's screw in .
and then you have to press function eight it is on your laptop . function , eight , . the blue one , f_n_ . is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and . , 's screw in . you just have to push it in really hard . push the screw . alright i've never attached to anything . it's taking it little bit there you go . alright , so , if you are able to get access to the report that was online or if i'm the only one who is .
that was just on the on the company web site , . 'cause was like googling and then i'm like it won't let me google . alright no , how do play again ? the it's above draw . there are three thingy if it's way at the bottom . under three icons and it's the one that looks like desk . there are y_s . so this is our working design presentation . had bit of some issues with this , because wasn't able to find everything needed , but that's we're still in early stages . so , , this is this .
the it's above draw . there are three thingy if it's way at the bottom . under three icons and it's the one that looks like desk . there are y_s . so this is our working design presentation . had bit of some issues with this , because wasn't able to find everything needed , but that's we're still in early stages . so , , this is this . though the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that coffee grinder . it works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work .
lefty loosey , righty tighty . never heard that before , that's good . i'll think of that every time now . it's gonna stick in your head . that's good one it'll stick with you . have nothing on my screen . here we are . , it's fine . we have couple new requirements that was just e-mailed before the meeting and that we have to keep in in in mind as we're creating this . we didn't bring it up yet , or in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about we're not gonna worry about that .
to produce it , . to produce it , yes . and wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and half euros without having to make too many other compromises . but what else are we gonna put , not that i'm really gung-ho about it , what else you can put in remote to make it technologically advanced though . so like other than just making it look good , how is it it can look really and still have the same up-n-down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy new remote ? but why are we why are we aiming for technological advancement ? everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology , it could use it could mean , not . that's good thing to keep in mind . if they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology . if someone's looking to buy new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ?
si simplicity and fashion . simplicity , fashion . simplicity and fashion . those are very good goals , , that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do . simplicity and fashion and , , or usability speci however you wanna say that , which includes an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , so that you don't have to travel around lot . what can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , like why would it not be ? i'm just wondering . it's lot to do with battery , but that's just my . the battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents it , without scattering . so 's just the quality of the chip .
i'm just wondering . it's lot to do with battery , but that's just my . the battery and that that the chip takes the data and presents it , without scattering . so 's just the quality of the chip . the quality quality of all the components really , , we can't really do anything shoddy work , 'cause it's gonna be visible down the line . so our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? how useful that number is if we're not doing . voice recognition , which feel like voice recognition is not necessary in remote control , like it might be necessary for t_v_ but not for the remote , . it's , , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech . seems little bit .
or like single professionals . single it's it's hard to narrow it down . it's really hard to figure out now . the product appeals across quite broad range of ages . we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , people who have problems with technology , , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , and that might be older people , but then we've also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people . we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , we can define it by like the demographic of like how much money they have to spend like that , like , it has to be someone who owns television , and like how recently have they bought their television like that thing . aim for an income group . that's good point . so it's more useful to to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because , , things so different will appeal to different people , but . there're couple functions do we want something so that do we want some thing to find it if it's lost ?
like said before , fifty per cent of of the fru like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it . and if we're talking about making something easy that goes along with it so it wouldn't be like random thing to add in . it would be relevant to like the overall goal , so . that'll probably be good . we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions . so let's do that quickly . so we want something to keep it from getting lost . and we want we want large buttons for the essential things . large , accessible buttons for the essentials . we want possibility to to get possibility to get the extra functions .
battery battery use . but that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really . but we might as . so you never have to change the battery . we should investigate whether it needs battery . suspect the remote control does need battery , but if you can . just 'cause it is an electronic device , the charging . it it does . don't don't think of way you can operate chip and convert that much data without without one . without the energy , .
yes , did that . hopefully it is there for people . looks like there are looks like there's second one of mine that's that didn't do , it's from like an earlier project , so under the shared folder , it might not even be under yours as . where is that ? yours is only have three , have like our three . so in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements . at least that's what have in . that's what have as , rose so . you don't have mine ? no , but that's 'cause yours is in the e-mail separate , like it's not on the server .
no , but that's 'cause yours is in the e-mail separate , like it's not on the server . but if open it and then save it , probably will be there . never mind you can't save it to the . 'll figure that out in the meantime .
fourteen twenty six . lovely to see you all again . it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . these are our minutes from the functional design . we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it . our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . and in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , possibility for extra functions , like sliding sliding piece and long-life battery or charging station . now three presentations . i'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching .
haven't received any specific visuals of this yet . 'cause i'm imagining like double-curved is like , , like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like single vertical-ish looking thing , but i've no idea . this is what i'm . i'm not , but i'll let as soon as get any pictures . we do have double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . but the titanium , they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . just all things to keep in mind . just an interesting marketing element . that's about all have to do , . hope didn't go through that too quickly .
that should be alright , actually . ri what do you have to press , five ? keep pressing lots of . how relevant all of this gonna be . if anything , the that they gave me . it's not plugged in , quite in enough . there we are . there we go . so we're gonna look little bit at trend watching . was given an executive summary that was market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year .
it would be easier on the hands . if it's latex if it's latexy , mean an if my understanding of latex case is that it's hard to protect inside , but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . it's and then it we would have to find way to protect like the chip and all that , . it's there's something to be said , we we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to repetitive stress injuries and things and and , something grippable , we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , . so something , instead of necess , grip , i'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , , and i'm envisioning more like , , the material that you have when you sit on like bicycle , so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for long time , like i'm imagining that thing , what that material's called . that given the list of materials was forwarded it's that seems doable . could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? we could colour-co-ordinate them , li the buttons could be fruit-shaped . for , or like couple main ones being like , , lemons or strawberries . could they be smelly ?
like , like carrots . or carrot shaped , . or like potato . or the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . like large button , that's what was thinking of , . what about the idea of like round remote ? instead of like vertical up and down one . like in terms of holding it . like that's shape of fruit . it'd be harder to bu buttons .
or your fingers ? that's ts how tend to do it . usually hold it in one hand . but then the buttons would have to be very small . or you want something that's shaped like mobile phone , so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb . 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around . don't you think ? no just thumb-sized . but like love the idea of the wheel like the ipod . but in order to get to all of them , .
no just thumb-sized . but like love the idea of the wheel like the ipod . but in order to get to all of them , . they would have to be within certain amount of space with each other . but if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much problem , perhaps . when i'm when i'm pressing buttons on my ipod , that's how do it , hold it and press the four . so you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb and and you find that works quite ? or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . it wel , it would each version of it has been little bit different , but , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore . is that the button on an ipod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like scroll thing ?
or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . it wel , it would each version of it has been little bit different , but , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore . is that the button on an ipod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like scroll thing ? 'cause it's like five , 'cause there's one in the middle . it's scroll , , it's wheel . the one have doesn't have the four on like around it , don't think . ts and you press the centre button , that's that's your all-purpose select button there . see , , . since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , . that's quite good design .
'cause it's like five , 'cause there's one in the middle . it's scroll , , it's wheel . the one have doesn't have the four on like around it , don't think . ts and you press the centre button , that's that's your all-purpose select button there . see , , . since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , . that's quite good design . why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things , but then how you could go back to the menu and like , if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual t_v_ . am wanting to say on the t_v_ , 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , ?
and then you could still have that available . an screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . it could be difficult in practice , . also , 'cause you would be looking down at the screen , than back up at your t_v_ and people don't wanna do that . we probably have to get going , don't we ? we have we've about fifteen minutes left , so i'm i'm gonna continue with my pres presentation . i've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so i'll just bring that up and show you all before we move on . and then like the the covers could be spongy latex wherea but the actual model could be titanium . if get any more information of fruits and vegetables , i'll let . could could we could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ?
, it would take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries . it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the how reliable it is , but as far as know , the technology is good . haven't gotten any , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than regular battery , but but if we're using an cheaper chip , then it'll even out , . but over time , it's but if you if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker looking . got whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . they're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . don't really to tell you as far as decisions . wasn't really given any options , was just given that this is how they're done . 't can't really tell you . tell you whole lot about how it works .
but any decisions on . if they're if they're really options . i'm , did . al all circuit boards are the same , . it's fairly fairly standard . then we'll move on to the case . bu if we decided on like simple , regular , or an advanced chip , . here's the here's the thing on the chips that that got . simple , regular , advanced chip on print . the chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we don't have to worry about that .
don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . it might be for changing the volume . it would be for changing the volume , but how useful it'd be for changing the channel . but don't would really work . 'cause you don't have control over numbers or we have five minutes left for the meeting , so . you really need buttons for changing channel . it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . and otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , , black with red sticking out and no it's gonna inevitably start looking like those group of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . so , have scroll for volume ? or for all those secret functions ?
everything i've wha what i've what i've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's like hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . not too thick layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . the inside is hard . don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , that that's done for us . so we we do want latex . and probably in colours , fruity , vegetable colours . let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip suppose . and we want curved case , ? we don't really the difference is , ? i'm thinking curved of some sort .
i'm thinking curved of some sort . we don't really the difference good point . interface , the type and the supplements . so push or scroll , ? and if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is scroll button . so in terms of in terms of economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . and if we had sc an on-screen thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . , it's it's it's fairly simple . for channel surfing scroll an actual like an ipod's scroll thing would be too fast , . say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but have no idea how much more expensive scroll wheel is than than pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so it might be better to put our money into the like the kinetic battery and the case because .
on off so like one through five , or no . on off , volume , favourite channels , and menu . about like , bit like radio presets . like radio type sorta situation ? we wouldn't even need the numbers . pre-set channels and then we're gonna need numbers one through zero , ? numbers seems is old-fashioned . but in order to pre-set cha you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . , you can just and you need some , , up down button , but the volume control could double for that , . finishing the meeting now .

like little lightning in it . what we call that one the rhombus , the rhombus . the little lightning bolt in it , very cute . could could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as power button ? the the rhombus rhombus ? that's the rhombus , . this one is known as the potato , it's it's how can present it ? it's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your hand . i've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one .

it would be difficult technologically , because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , so it's i'm not quite how it would work and then wonder if it's if it's more just gimmick then anything else . that's true , . ho how many times do you really , lose your remote control and would would device like that actually help you to find it ? there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make noise , but it would take lot more development than we have this afternoon . that's fair evaluation . we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . 'cause , the designs are very bright , so you're , they're gonna stick out , but . so do people have preference as far as feel and functionality ? feel like this is simil or it's what already exists so if we're trying to think of something like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init i'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . like this one , like why , it just it's like small but still like cute looking , .
that's good , that's good . there we go . it's possible , , . here , stick it on . put an extra the button on . why don't we do product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ? do we like we're supposed to have one that we do it for . that was was little vague on what exactly i'm supposed to do , but let me have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . do you need this or just write on the white board ? no , actually don't have like powerpointy thing , 'cause it would be redundant .
do we like we're supposed to have one that we do it for . that was was little vague on what exactly i'm supposed to do , but let me have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . do you need this or just write on the white board ? no , actually don't have like powerpointy thing , 'cause it would be redundant . it's like like joystick thing , , kinda push it . little smaller than that . no , kinda like it . that's hard to miss . it makes look more fruity as . it does , it's like there it could have stem like that , 'cause do like the stem .
no , actually don't have like powerpointy thing , 'cause it would be redundant . it's like like joystick thing , , kinda push it . little smaller than that . no , kinda like it . that's hard to miss . it makes look more fruity as . it does , it's like there it could have stem like that , 'cause do like the stem . it's like deformed foot , . it almost helps you ge keep grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers . like this one .
variety of colours are . like the idea of the that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . i'm leaning towards the potato . am worried about like using menu . in that like withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ? that on the ipod , , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level . but that has menu button separate from select button , whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ? this is , it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for list of choices . you find the choice that you want and you press you press the button . could these be used for going to submenus or .
she said it was one . is it technologically innovative ? not really , not so much , 'cause we we don't have the screen , we don't have fancy chip . other than what it looks like , if it's really kinetic battery is big one , so . the kinetic battery . in the battery , that's it . how many people would notice that , though ? but it but we t's there . but they'll notice it after like year , they'll be like , have never changed the battery . and if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty .
the kinetic battery . in the battery , that's it . how many people would notice that , though ? but it but we t's there . but they'll notice it after like year , they'll be like , have never changed the battery . and if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty . i'll give it three . just the material . 'cause it we could've picked lot of features that would've made it really alright . would say that it's , like fancy versus creative it's it's different .
but it but we t's there . but they'll notice it after like year , they'll be like , have never changed the battery . and if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty . i'll give it three . just the material . 'cause it we could've picked lot of features that would've made it really alright . would say that it's , like fancy versus creative it's it's different . but does that equal innovative ? i'll give it three . i'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , it's it's just it is just pushbuttons , so i'd give it four .
i'd i'd give it one . alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? is it gonna be yellow ? it it might be , 'cause that's our corporate colour , isn't it ? , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in we would make it little less little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one more conservative one , one that's more fruity . we might wanna keep it yellow . but if you had like silvery white . and can we have like an r_r_ inscribed on the bottom ? if we had yellow . alright , so it it's .
, corporate colour , we didn't keep that in we would make it little less little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one more conservative one , one that's more fruity . we might wanna keep it yellow . but if you had like silvery white . and can we have like an r_r_ inscribed on the bottom ? if we had yellow . alright , so it it's . fruity , so fruity . so it was inspired by the potato , so it's pretty fruity . it's mangoey too . mango that that that's much more trendy than potato one .
if we had yellow . alright , so it it's . fruity , so fruity . so it was inspired by the potato , so it's pretty fruity . it's mangoey too . mango that that that's much more trendy than potato one . mangoey is better , . i'm giving it one the mango put me over . what are what's everyone's numbers ? alright , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ?
i'll give it two , 'cause almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen . it's gonna be hard . and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , but like how it fits in the hand though so i'd go with two . worth the risk , . i'll i'll say two as . because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it bit at first , but the menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be bit confusing , but if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . i'll i'll say two . alright , awesome . and the ease of learning it . know you were saying that you're little bit nervous about that , .
i'm gonna i'm gonna give it four , 'cause that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it , you're not gonna find it , but anywhere else it's gonna stand out . i'd say i'd give it three , it depends on how tidy you are normally . i'd give it four . i'll give it five 'cause it would be easy to lose something like that , . alright , we also said simplicity , how how does it address just being simple ? simple to use or simple in design ? overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , so those are the next two things we're gonna look at . separate from fancy , like that thing . it like wants to be simple but it's not like simple , so i'm gonna give it two . i'm give it three .
just that it would se serve our audience . don't see why not . as long if we offer in in at least three different colour arrangements . so i'll give it two . i'll say two . alright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ? we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to have corporate logo , so let's let's make we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r_r_ on it . shall we all of them should have an r_r_ . all of them should have r_r_ , . and so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , fine .
we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to have corporate logo , so let's let's make we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r_r_ on it . shall we all of them should have an r_r_ . all of them should have r_r_ , . and so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , fine . now we're gonna look at finances . have an excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost , so let me exit out of this first . let me one more space . gonna zoom in real quick . we're using kinetic battery , ? we're using kinetic , .
we're using kinetic , . and we're having one per one , . simple , simple rather . it is pretty curvy . it's very curvy , so . never did get picture of those so don't really know . our case material supplements , we just skipped by them . don't we need plastic , and provided , . no , we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . the supplement is , it was rubber rather than latex .
do we have more than one special colour ? we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours . what the se the basic colour is though . special colours , isn't it ? per , but we know that we're having at least three colours , so . so let's say three . are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , , we'll like we'll have yellow and black . is that two special colours ? or or is white and black , then two more or . that thi that would be under yours .
we have six . we've got five . no , five . six , with the power . we'll do we wa are the buttons in special colour , special didn't get information on , does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where i'm getting confused . buttons , so . so the case material will just have one colour , , but then the buttons will be in special colours ? we're saying per unit . per unit , , . so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is could have up to thr the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there .
we're saying per unit . per unit , , . so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is could have up to thr the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there . alright , and each button , . like it like that . so special form ? they're all just push button , ? no , they're fine . material , we want them rubber as probably , . do have to do it per button , do ?
no , they're fine . material , we want them rubber as probably , . do have to do it per button , do ? no , don't . they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters . 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise , 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one . it's it's two to make it rubber . thirteen point seven . what can we reduce ? let's have our buttons all be one colour .
no , don't . they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters . 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise , 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one . it's it's two to make it rubber . thirteen point seven . what can we reduce ? let's have our buttons all be one colour . like the buttons . let's see what that would do . it's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway .
it's single-curved , we have no idea . we have no idea . didn't get any pictures . it's single curved . it's single curved . t's not the . it's the kinetic battery that's expensive , but we have simple chip , single curve , case material is rubber and it's special colour , but that's important . that is important . six buttons we have to have six buttons . how did it get more expensive , what did you just change ?
it was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen . no , , not . what just happened . now it's twelve . we , they are . what was our target price again ? twelve point five . twelve point five . twelve point five . so we're just just about there .
twelve point five . twelve point five . twelve point five . so we're just just about there . so we're , . we're all set then . we're all set . saved that to our our big shared folder , so . back to agenda . are the are the costs under twelve fifty euro ?
we we worked together , but we were making like we made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , and how we could like improve on the on the design . so it was bit of both really , we just started out by each taking colour of clay and just fooling around with it and came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really . it was fun . so done with the management , felt managed . we did first of all giving our meetings the time , and second we actually we we did good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings . it's kinda fun . and happens sometimes is that you tend to have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . that happened to me all the time though . but here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there . was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions , but we were able to do it regardless , so .
found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings . for some of the meetings , . especially last time , . the last time we had lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , what , like we we couldn't answer every single question . and felt the first two meetings , that was coming in with no information , and not made me really like , , throwing together powerpoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite . had so much information and so much to talk about . it was interesting what came out like later , like as was doing the when was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me , that more points came out from your presentation even . i'm little am little disappointed that we didn't do something for losing the remote , because that was big point . that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like . the problem was , even when we just were creating from the excel file , there wasn't like option to select to somehow have it included , so there was no we could be like , it has it included .
added slides , added couple slides each time , but that was about it . didn't even think about adding slides , 'cause would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in didn't even think about adding more . the thing was they would provide an agenda with like several points , but it wouldn't have slide for each point . and that's the only way remember that need to go other that point . know personally when do powerpoint , that's what do and so had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and would do your three . you have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like good . the slogan on it ? no , no , definitely not . no no no . we no , don't think we need to the and , especially if the yellow and black one .
the slogan on it ? no , no , definitely not . no no no . we no , don't think we need to the and , especially if the yellow and black one . 'cause was like , it could go around the outside . we just need the the r_r_ , . is it yellow and blue ? or yellow and blue . lemme go to the web page . was just kinda going by the web page , 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or .
or yellow and blue . lemme go to the web page . was just kinda going by the web page , 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or . it is black , grey . grey is better than black , doesn't look so bumblebeeish . don't really like yellow in general . now understand the random like newsclippings . but it wasn't it interesting that it was interesting that our market marketing expert did not agree with the marketing the marketing choices , , like that was bit of conflict . finish meeting now . will feel like if you're really doing like really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , it's an they were so not backed up , it would just be sentence like we did survey , this is what people said .
works for me . so that that we're we're making remote control which is thrilling but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model if you had time to check the in real life if you checked the the corporate website . we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary that nobody really thinks about and try to make it like john lewis or if you go to debenham's . so we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in user friendly slick sleek way . way we're gonna go about doing that is at first we're gonna start on the basics . and that's where i'm gonna need you the user interface designers and the the other designer that 't remember , the the i_d_ and the u_i_d_ the industrial designer on alright , getting into it to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're you are the bottom you're like no you can't do that you can't have x_ and y_ at the same time . there you go . and then we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , like you probably got the same emails did but the idea of , yes coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , like that . and so we'll work up from there and then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as the last stage where you build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ you you can keep on the at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible to try of sync it all up . so that's the detailed design .
very much so . hell of soccer player but total bastard nonetheless . he looks really tall , like he's gotta be like six six . he is big guy . so really like jeff buckley . you heard of jeff buckley ? that's 'cause like not very many people have . and might as throw british person in there you can't go wrong with radiohead . it's so it really works just like pen only makes noises . it's kinda weird .
i'm gonna start downloading it . 'm just gonna put down one one c_d_ . afro beat orchestra , very . afro beat orchestra ? fift they like fifteen members from brooklyn . and i'm hoping to go to the concert in belgium , in brussels in april first . it's supposed to be in brussels anyways . thing love about edinburgh love came from glasgow and i'm happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately . didn't even read those . shouldn't admit that .
fift they like fifteen members from brooklyn . and i'm hoping to go to the concert in belgium , in brussels in april first . it's supposed to be in brussels anyways . thing love about edinburgh love came from glasgow and i'm happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately . didn't even read those . shouldn't admit that . that's what powerpoint presentation is for . it's they're designed specifically to ignore . it's the five by five , 't read that much . yes yes yes see that .
or at least get work visa for while and then decide . that's the music grew up listening to . now think of so many other ones . and so there something miss about my hometown . that's how it works . burritos that cost less than eight pounds . any thing that are like free . two two bucks . where are you from in california by the way ? grew up in san diego , but la jolla , p_b_ .
grew up in san diego , but la jolla , p_b_ . did you really ? i'm from san diego as . but really last lived in san francisco , haven't lived in cali haven't lived in southern california since was eighteen . going to like north carol i'm you you just can't get better burrito than what's available in the in san diego . 'cause in san diego the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern california they steam them . it must make all the difference . it really does . t's it's there's other things too there's you just can't place it like when went to school in the u_ in santa barbara which is central california the mexican food is , it's just not good like and it's like two bucks , like literally two bucks for this massive miss good call on that . where you from in san diego ?
have think about it . i'm i'm certainly op it seems like it it seems like it's certainly do-able isn't it . or if we can't have full mobile phone remote that has some other useful function . no no , good idea , good idea . we'll see what see what like that . remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . like the little cover thingies . that's true , we we probably have some time , we should brainstorm bit like what we wanna do , go back to don't really have any . let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . ts ts ts .
i'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause . start your minutes . t's given it's gonna be universal , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that was thinking like all the other things you could get remote to do , like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing , but then , i've never been fan of those huge remotes that have like million buttons , you can't tell what they do . so initial ideas . but i'm thinking i'm thinking p_d_a_ design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can flip around all sorts of different things . that'd be different . that's slick isn't it . like stylist like just . so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect . so we've got this an idea of trade-off between size and functionality .
in in like . isn't there name for them ? think they're just called face plates ? something , we'll have to come up with name , patent it . we should we should come up with fuzzy one as . for those cold winter days . it wouldn't be such bad idea to have like locator device , simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . but if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote . cou could we not do something where like just little lit like literally just very small thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . we bundle it as phone then you can always call it .
something , we'll have to come up with name , patent it . we should we should come up with fuzzy one as . for those cold winter days . it wouldn't be such bad idea to have like locator device , simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . but if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote . cou could we not do something where like just little lit like literally just very small thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . we bundle it as phone then you can always call it . if you're not doing that then we can have something that just rings from either there used to be those whistling devices but that's little bit annoying . kinda like how on lot of cordless regular phones , you have page button and it goes , could we do something like that ? we could design into that .
we could design into that . this material quality as like what we can think about what apple 's been really successful with this surgical white business or this sleek . and that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so . we do have the minimum am amount we were talking finances , selling forty pound remote would or forty dollar remote , twenty five euro remote would be pretty it's pretty expensive so we might wanna trade off some of the features for lower price . without without getting into that whole like go down to bargain store remote bargain store universal remote that's black and massive , some balance there in somewhere . but have think about what we can do , have think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it and . or if you our users in mind , like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . we're talking twenty five pounds or twenty five euros ? twenty five euros . they're all weaker than they're all stronger than the dollar .
twenty five euros . they're all weaker than they're all stronger than the dollar . although , computer parts , all if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the states . like do you know fry's ? huge computer electronics store ? they serve they sa tha they will sell things overseas so you can buy in america and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty pounds about . so let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , i'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the project documents , so if you wa need reminder about what we've talked about the different trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . and so for that . let's just head back to work on what we were talking about bef goi getting into . with half an hour ?
gotta plug you in . might have to hit function eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . that's page one of my presentation . for your first powerpoint it's lovely . so the method . we're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res successfully complete this project . remote control works as follows . this is all pretty basic you . sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , and that actually compose the messages and usually the way remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . user interface controls the chip , that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as .
it needs , . that shouldn't be problem . the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do . that's the end of my presentation . very much nathan . if next we can have the user interface developer go ahead and make brief presentation that'd be as . plug yourself in here . hit function eight real quickly , hold down . looks like you're in . is it plugged in ?
that's very doable . the difficulty wh would be in like you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . you have something that picks up voice from far away if it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing that's just little chip or whatever that has the page button , that could be voice activated too . it's good point . little sticky pad to stick on top of your television . and you just say something to into that and it finds your the other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of remote control and put the more complicated things into voice control . or an isolated magnet like , or something that wouldn't interfere that'd be the technical thing but like that , like that , the voice recognition for the paging system . so it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . and the younger market could use the voi voice control method and the older market might might exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . making it just an option ?
's definitely an option technically . i've looked into costs of touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be almost as cheap as button method at this point . 'cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these four or five basic functions , you can have menu options to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that re is the sleek thing we're going for . gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty euro goal for selling these things . worth looking into . it seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . the microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism . so it's just something to consider . we'll cross that bridge in la slightly later stages of development but know , that's perfectly viable question . so i'm seeing that we're gonna just focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but we'll make sleek simple functioned remote control .
i'm not that's sincerely correct , if you take the example of mobile phone that trying to pass portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . just the casing . we could have the casing , the the face plates . back to the the cost the material . we have to ask whether we're going to include certain number of face plates with the package ? that's something for say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up . and the other question is , if we do include them are we really in position to evaluate that market ? we haven't done any tests on face plates and whether see if there if there's even interest out there . off the top of my head it sounds like gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have nokia model x_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of remote control .
that would be best . let's based on what sh on what you have all said to me let's go for plastic built or plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and that's idea . with touch screen for the basic functions . and we'll tha let's provisionally let's go for touch screen one with several submenus for possible extra that one put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . do we have minute it occurs to me that if we have touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . 'cause it would have docking base ? but then again that costs as . so these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ? those new ones .
but then again that costs as . so these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ? those new ones . can we afford that ? can we afford to include one of those ? and will somebody buy it if we don't ? don't 't see anybody buying lap remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some new battery technology . so let's go with touch screen with some with with some cutting edge battery technology t's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing presented plastic simple so . for twelve euros ? you can put the we could suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest , people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs go through menu we'll do the aesthetics .
you can put the we could suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest , people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs go through menu we'll do the aesthetics . so we'll touch screen and the battery , focus on presentation . it's with this voice recognition option as just as for the simple functions the the on off , channels , volume , and small paging function . even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging just some simple button that's just another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some paging . so any comments ? thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this . since we're doing touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the the actual interface part of it and things like that ? or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody . what what would be on that touch screen ? 'cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and logo or motto , 't remember exactly what you said .
's too much . think we just need to come up with black and red interface on the touch screen . i'm i'm in agreement with that , i'm wondering how we're gonna get we put fashion into electronics onto this device . but if we're gonna use touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like temporary comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is bit much to have it like engraved on the back . i'm hoping for subliminal half millisecond as it turns on . you would think . it seems like it would suffice to have just the r_r_ on there . jus but not . if it comes from above . people aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .
imagine that we could specify . don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , and that would cost us more . and if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . and just little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many euro . one thing that noticed was that most remotes operate on infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . so you notice when you push button on remote you can't see anything coming out of it but there is light coming out of the remote and the television can detect that . and if you were to record if you were to make video recording you could actually see the light . one thing that might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just as fun gimmick . so you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .
that's my concern too . if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . my personal preference is i'll just throw my cards on the table , we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and was thinking about was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . so we're not so confined by one style and say some , say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over then we're in bad situation . can we do marketing piloting too ? try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ? it's an option , but actually there's i've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing now which actually might even come into play beforehand , it may help us decide for now . very much nathan . that's perfect , so that makes sense for you to take it from here .
it's an option , but actually there's i've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing now which actually might even come into play beforehand , it may help us decide for now . very much nathan . that's perfect , so that makes sense for you to take it from here . so , 'cause found some interesting things . you waiting for me ? fascinating , compelling even . know , what teaser ain't it . so current market trends . was looking at what's going on in the remote control market now and what's going on in other design fields , to see what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . remote control now everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface .
like it , like it . should have mentioned this . as far as the rubber that we can use we can use rubber as part of the case , it has consistency of those stress balls . might be an interesting way to go . slick , slick . so something to sit on for now . so overall we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new perhaps the double curve thing and this rubber option is our best way to go for now . interface , the interface graphics for the . but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really non-issue . like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter .
taped with duck tape and what have you , you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber . very much so . we can have duck tape casing . that goes against the whole fancy something , new line , but worth shot . it could go with the granola crowd . it could be , it could be , . that's what know . for that sarah . so interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . so yur user interface , , is aspects of computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise perceive .
it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places . but can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be really main cost source then ? my estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote , that's just an estimate though . to produce each one . you are always the dampers on these projects . know and our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? you industrial designers . do we remember ? there was some flexibility with that . there is , it's just , it is question of and how much ca does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .
you industrial designers . do we remember ? there was some flexibility with that . there is , it's just , it is question of and how much ca does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . can we justify it ? from twelve fifty if we wanna get our fift hundred per cent profit margin that would mean selling it from twenty five . if you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five . so from the board , , that's true , and that's to be fair the the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five euros , so we could probably shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . where do you come up with these numbers ? that's just off the top of my head , it is pending further emails .
what does the cost look like ron ? is it cheaper to do the v_r_ or to do the touch screen ? my is , definitely have to agree with that last comment . and we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , we can stick with what we've already got . in lot other ways too . so i'm getting alright so more or less you think that of the two of , the voice recognition will be better . it's our lower risk option which for now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option . we will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . it's you and me outside little here . so and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step ?
'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but that's our next step , it'll be developing of prototype . are we going to talk now about the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ? we'll just run through it , , . you discussed either lithium or solar power . would the solar power be enough to fuel voice recognition ? or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel voice recognition remote control ? the solar power definitely would be but just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install small backup battery . just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to it's true . what of people with like the t_v_ in their basement , like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having secondary source is probably . it works about the same as solar powered calculator , and how those those don't really require that much light , , but little more light than calculator , but we're not talking about lot of light .
we'll just run through it , , . you discussed either lithium or solar power . would the solar power be enough to fuel voice recognition ? or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel voice recognition remote control ? the solar power definitely would be but just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install small backup battery . just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to it's true . what of people with like the t_v_ in their basement , like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having secondary source is probably . it works about the same as solar powered calculator , and how those those don't really require that much light , , but little more light than calculator , but we're not talking about lot of light . doesn't have to be out taking sunbath for few hours day or anything . what do you think ron ?
you don't need to pick it up it could be selling point . if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . do you think people that are people that buy remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . true , and probabl we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as basic manual too , . have to have buttons on it too as . but that's done , that's no bother if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever they might have or like who is it , apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the sub-woofers like clear and glass and and then they got these little pyramidal type of speakers . why not have little rounded thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it . 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as . with the bu . and menu button and , use channel button to scroll through the menu if they want to record programmes or whatever we can sort that out .
although we do wh is i'm recalling that she mentioned that we need to get away from the surgical white brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have very tasteful wood coloured or earth tone still , , , along those lines . that would be kinda neat . like that , like that idea lot . let's see what we can do as far as that goes . and the the material like the plastics and , we were discussing that being using like rubber softer feel , li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's bit gives just bit . something where it's more advanced form of plastic that has some tactile response to it . just the squishy feel . which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . let's see if we can do squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . but to be fair , , , you just you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .
it wasn't in the way but , whatever . no , don't worry about it . the , was just gonna assign tasks in the next anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and ? so have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? or are we just going to go with one ? ..it's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market little bit , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very . it's tough situation , but having more cases also costs more so there's an idea . then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have , , natural wood colour , like stained wood and , , olive green . that wouldn't be so much of problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing . copying imac's for ipod mac apple's colour scheme .
so have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? or are we just going to go with one ? ..it's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market little bit , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very . it's tough situation , but having more cases also costs more so there's an idea . then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have , , natural wood colour , like stained wood and , , olive green . that wouldn't be so much of problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing . copying imac's for ipod mac apple's colour scheme . get in there . that's probably good id so let's work on multiple case colours . but , stick with the same kinda , the same basic non-remote remote design .
for it , for it . that's not you . that's how the . this is , this is very high-powered here , double-clicking , there we go . so the moral of the story from our last minute last meeting was that we that we had meetings from we had presentations done by the industrial designer , or from nathan , and ron and from sarah about what we can do here and what limitations we're operating with excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop remote with voice recognition , i_e_ that had vaguely non-remote like shape because you didn't really need to use it as remote since you could just use your voice . that would include some mostly just the simple design features for television operation but with slide or fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . and the the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ were asked to go ahead and start developing prototype for us to look at . that's sorted , back to the main meet here , , go ahead and take it away . we have assembled our prototype , . what's to be said about it ?
if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . no it's important to we talked quite bit about the the interchangeable faces and what we've done here is come up with bit of natural look here we call it fruity if you will . , that's interchangeable and it would be desirable for the for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something little bit more subdued but this is something that can be done and as you can see on the television there we have the voice detector device on the top there . it is an option . that's this here . so that that will work quite with with regard to finding this contraption . what other things do we see here , , if you give it touch it does have actually bit of spongy feel , , so that will work with regards to our market . and let's see , clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . do you have anything else to add to that ? worried about the materials , it is the entire thing is covered in rubber coating so it's very durable , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped .
worried about the materials , it is the entire thing is covered in rubber coating so it's very durable , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . and as you can see and if you touch it it does have that squishy feel . it's actually important to note that the television , if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that it actually is edible inside . fact , if you noticed , but wrote the the company's name on the telephone screen , that was kinda . done , edible televisions , it's wave of the future . this was actually an apple on the inside . do we need to worry about rot factors ? it's encased in new type of polymer . there's preservatives involved , we don't need to worry , . we got bit ahead of ourselves , know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but .
it's encased in new type of polymer . there's preservatives involved , we don't need to worry , . we got bit ahead of ourselves , know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but . no but it's couple years off at least . it's pos possible new product . but that's that sums up the main features of our of the remote , if you have any questions or whether that whether we need to worry about any other marketing areas or anything of that nature . did we come in under budget ? we did , . this cost to put this into production , we're looking at about what was our goal ? it was twelve fifty euro and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .
we did , . this cost to put this into production , we're looking at about what was our goal ? it was twelve fifty euro and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . so was quite pleased with that . one thing that we didn't do we had choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for classic rubber button and since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite and that's what helped keep the cost down . so even though it has lot of modern technology , the voice recognition , in lot of ways it's just simple remote and if we shopped around for other manufacturers we might be able to get even cheaper . did we talk about the voice recognition option ? and no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? so so on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition console and it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . but the voice recognition incorporates the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw come up with .
just veneer really , . actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put new new new plate on top of that . and the whole thing . so there are we definitely priced out spongy even spongier non-natural look materials which worked out fine . we also continued on with the ideas that following apple's colour schemes with the the light orange and the green . it's still an option if we need it . very , job . like it , brilliant . what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , got me you've got you provided number that actually sounds quite . the trouble is was just given this by finance .
we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , . with back-up battery ? with the ba . and clever , clever , done . the voice recognition area actually doubles as as the solar cell area . so that would mean we've got bit of it's speaker and sensor at the same time isn't it ? it's just making use of the same space and the same materials , but , one big curve you could say . and the case , it's more of single-curved case , would be that be the general and we've got rubber skin material throughout . push button interface with this other drop-down so we've got two push button interfaces don't we ? and special it's we've got wood materi rubbery type material that throughout , .
doesn't match up does it ? so what we could do perhaps , simple fix would to switch away from the solar cells or take out the back-up battery . how do you feel about that ? that if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have battery so i'm not that what the sell is on that . we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying look my remote isn't working what am gonna do ? people'd be real upset . in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . what's difficult , we have all these things integral to the to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in way . if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , it's either or . although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental the solar cell is big piece of the way we're marketing this as like natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if i've done my math correctly .
people'd be real upset . in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . what's difficult , we have all these things integral to the to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in way . if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , it's either or . although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental the solar cell is big piece of the way we're marketing this as like natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if i've done my math correctly . you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing that's what sets us apart ? which , it's that's what setting us into this young market , that's where we started from , so , and perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . and the reality is , for me from an ideological stand point , i'd like to stick with the the solar cell , but have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and that that we need to come to compromise here and move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . unfortunately that's our best option . we might have to do that .
which , it's that's what setting us into this young market , that's where we started from , so , and perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . and the reality is , for me from an ideological stand point , i'd like to stick with the the solar cell , but have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and that that we need to come to compromise here and move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . unfortunately that's our best option . we might have to do that . it's the only way we're gonna get below our goal isn't it ? of twelve fifty . 'cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're and we can't get rid of the removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of , , nor would changing the case materials . so that looks like to be the only thing . so that would be the it's major change but . gotta do what you gotta do .
alright , so we're in agreement on that . unfortunately we are . no , that was good compromise you brought forward sarah . moving along swiftly . so now we just go to the project evaluation which will allow sarah to take over . that would be me . can you reach , that would be , . that'd be brilliant . didn't even do that one on purpose either , damn . , was just evaluating from what we know of how our product's working now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important .
we might have we might have lost that granola market again that we're that's true . was just go on . they don't own tellys anyway do they ? so , , this one's bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , . got this slide from the coach and i'm not what it's connected to . so we are going to discuss our project process and that is gonna go into my report . so this is the point where we go out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and and how worked , , . as in within the team or ? so it's just open mic thing or . it's , so .
are we considering these points here ? they're starting blocks . what do you feel about the process ? in general , for day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , considering the little amount of input we had going in . and the technology has definitely been help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new . we didn't use the whiteboard . no , no whiteboard . no , we didn't . we could now if that'd make up for it but really and feel like if you had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . and , also had not been intrigued about the pen , don't woulda used it , didn't write barely anything .
in general , for day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , considering the little amount of input we had going in . and the technology has definitely been help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new . we didn't use the whiteboard . no , no whiteboard . no , we didn't . we could now if that'd make up for it but really and feel like if you had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . and , also had not been intrigued about the pen , don't woulda used it , didn't write barely anything . was taking notes more often than usual just 'cause liked the pen , . was pretty tack though . am disappointed didn't get note back from my personal coach .
that would be kinda creepy . that'd be weird . attempts to contact coach ineffective . what coaching is that really ? what if really needed something . so don't there was lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever what we wanted until the budget came down on us , . and even then we did get decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . with the natural look . that's very natural . very natural look .
they were good . it's fun , it was it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the time and filled in the gaps enough . at the same time you had enough room to just make things up , which was fun . do your own . though did feel like the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . it's just me but didn't actually get any information for the last presentation . that's true , got this spreadsheet . nothing , didn't even get an email , like that was it . so , , feel like that was slightly lacking but then , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . that was that was an issue kept finding with regard to no but also when was reporting about what each of us was doing was often confused as to what you were doing and then also felt like lot of our discussion would centre around specifically what my task was because that was the interface portion which was what the whole project was about but and then in the end our jobs melded together little bit more , which was fine .
the first time i've ever done anything like project project management . usually organise crap , it's one thing to do , set up party with your friends , ? but you felt that you could keep the , , suspension of disbelief like like the role and the ? except for couple moments where it just got out of hand and knew we were all lying through our teeth , other than that could only imagine . had to admit , as soon as we started as soon as we got the play-doh , the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . in in legos ? be fun with legos too , like make remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship legos did you ever used to build spaceships with legos everybody knows best spaceships ever . you felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? no , no , , don't was just it's true ? though we didn't actually other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , but feel like if this was team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings .
if there was ri . didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , was afraid was gonna break something actually . that's it 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . dunno what woulda shown on that board . true , but it didn't even occur to me as an option , that would have but know that consciously didn't . it's just like the paper what really needed the paper for . because i've got this laptop . standard , used it 'cause it's literally in front of me . wanna see the output files from these , from the digital paper . looks really professional .
is it any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? that's the thing got in the email got this powerpoint file but this slide was just there , . that slide was like that ? didn't change this one . we're on the track . kinda like you can't . no , none . they still do their job . they're fine actually . am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form don't .
didn't change this one . we're on the track . kinda like you can't . no , none . they still do their job . they're fine actually . am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form don't . circle would be alright , different . does kinda make you wonder , , how much can you do with remote control ? it's like inventing new car .
it's like inventing new car . it's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road , ? what is that ? our limited ability to think outside the box ? so this was other costs . are we back into project mood ? this is forty ish we should go on bit about the project eval , . how long was our meeting supposed to be ? how much time do we have left ? about you but felt like bit under-stimulated on the whole thing .
about you but felt like bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . like , what like what am really doing , what is . at the beginning it started out and felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking lot of work and was like had like all this brainstorming was doing and then suddenly was like t's just another two minute presentation that you don't really care about anyway so type away . it was the real . what like we all knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . definitely when when first filled out the questionnaire was marking it probably higher in terms of how much had to how much stressed over it and then by the time got to the last one was like , , not very much . was also realisation of you just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which wasn't so clear to me at the beginning . very much , . actually didn't do that though , every single one all the presentations either added slides or edited . added like five slides too , but , mine too .
wanna know how our product would fare . 't just leave it there . it would fail , it'd be huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . it would take extensive marketing , , an apple with red button on top , even am sceptical . but the whole . don't we designed it to look little bit like face . it's happy face . actually that looked lot more like tongue from previous to fr some other design modifications . hope you appreciate the incorporation of some tin foil from random kit-kat bar that happened to be consumed . an interesting day all in all would say .
no just this closing one . no we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could do it we did the project evaluation based on sarah's evaluation of on off switches and . we got it to be . like cutting corners . though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . which i'm not is the same thing , at the time that just made more sense , but could see if they were really asking about us . 'cause we di we had thu think about it . and it's all recorded , woo-hoo . what i'm gonna i'm gonna put i'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so i'll put all that into the final report as , or as much as seems like not like the articles and , like because and if and , but i'll put most of it in the reports . it'd be so if we get copy of the recording .
there's guy studying it here , , he's studying ums and ahs . filler words or ? they're called disfluencies . that's good word for it . we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things . just add some prefixes , sounds classier . exactly will save this into the project documents . find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email lot , just out of boredom , like come on gimme something . , pretty compulsively during meetings , like , . come on give me some information .
there is another one . is this one of those media player ? the default track . have different one . it was david burns , look into the eyeball . that's one that seems to be shipping with it shipped with for while , this is the new version . so is that close ? we'll call that doner . that's the end of the meeting . feel like i'm signing off .
the default track . have different one . it was david burns , look into the eyeball . that's one that seems to be shipping with it shipped with for while , this is the new version . so is that close ? we'll call that doner . that's the end of the meeting . feel like i'm signing off .
just do it on the arrow . or how about click ? here is our agenda for this meeting . we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . we're gonna get to know each other little bit better . tool training , we're going to , , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . we're gonna make project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . here is our project . we're gonna make new remote control that's original , trendy and also user-friendly . and how we are going to do it is each of us is going to we're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate t_v_ , blah blah blah .
and then , if wind in the willows badger . and then if brian . he's liverpudlian writer . badgers are in that one too . and i'm last . look at my sad sad giraffe . no , that's good . no , no , no , it ends up looking like some dinosaur , but whatever . even much about giraffes , but love the way they look . they're just such odd creatures , .
they'll be phasing v_h_s_ out shortly . but it's still there , so if po if we're gonna do it or if it's not like sony , if it's like . it needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal . they're never universal . esp especially if you buy not big product , d_v_d_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the . something from sam's club . so we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals . and what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways . and another thing that is important is the the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . if it's just flat and boring those don't nobody wants to buy those any more .
anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that . just bad ones . what kinda battery would we want to use ? because battery changing is usually . do some of them use triple a_s though ? some use triple a_s . some but , then it's if we need to do triple we can , but most people usually have double a_s around . so double or triple ? but that has to do with the size of it too . as long as we know that issue is here we can triple .
some use triple a_s . some but , then it's if we need to do triple we can , but most people usually have double a_s around . so double or triple ? but that has to do with the size of it too . as long as we know that issue is here we can triple . if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with triple . can you with small lithium battery ? but it's , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . we're closing the meeting . next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes .
it's very important . yes , it is important for the remote control world . could be , . do we really need to provide more information on what r_s_i_ is ? like channel , volume , power . that's what my web site said , . that's pretty good though . would assume so . we're supposed to as remote control experts . it's like if you're holding it to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , .
like channel , volume , power . that's what my web site said , . that's pretty good though . would assume so . we're supposed to as remote control experts . it's like if you're holding it to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , . but also so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . and so personally that we need modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . so saying from your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is .
we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . that'd be lovely . didn't they didn't our rival companies manufacture remote that you would press the button on the t_v_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it . it's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . , that's true . like go to the base . we could definitely include that if we wanted to . if it's within our price . are we ready for our last presentation , amber ? i'm just trying to move it .
usually smart chip is just chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete fair range of functions . how much extra would the additional chip be ? is that gonna push us over our production costs ? wouldn't , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from newer company . and they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap . power source , figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . typically remote has either two double a_s or four triple a_s , sometimes three . it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so large on-off button would probably be good . selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the d_v_d_ player or the t_v_ or the stereo system .
wouldn't , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from newer company . and they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap . power source , figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . typically remote has either two double a_s or four triple a_s , sometimes three . it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so large on-off button would probably be good . selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the d_v_d_ player or the t_v_ or the stereo system . smart chip that perverts that permits , , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . this is my fifty second design . power source over here .
this is just like rough schematic . so this would be the front ? so this is the internal workings . so the red would be the front of the remote though , ? that's gonna be what's communicating with the t_v_ , but the other bulb , , is good to just to indicate , i'm doing something , it's like reassurance . the the light up . like that we know the battery's working . so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , 'cause when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , , when push this button , is it working ? it'd probably be lighting up the key too , ? we can skip that whole thing .

it'd probably be lighting up the key too , ? we can skip that whole thing . so you can put it in the dark . and that's good . we should make it glow in the dark . anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you you said already that we needed large on-off button , you think . that that's good idea , because that's one of the most important buttons . just , should it be larger buttons in general , like the examples that had , they were swi quite small . so should we try and go that has larger buttons ? like that would be in as in like in for the design , , .
except the entire screen . it's the whole screen . you can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , it's like . so it's like separate channel from like what you're watching ? but it's becoming out-dated now , because of the internet . nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so those are our new product requirements . so , do we have to include the company colour within that ? it's part of the logo . company colour being yellow . what we're going to do now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting .
because even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . it's gonna make it nicer . they want something user-friendly , so . even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and couple extra , 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons . so we want for our target group would we say , , young and old , all age ranges , all , not kids , ? no , kids need to know how to use remote , would think . most of them will intuitively pick it up though . they gotta change between disney channel , cartoon network . so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range what about technic technical specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? we need it all .
no , kids need to know how to use remote , would think . most of them will intuitively pick it up though . they gotta change between disney channel , cartoon network . so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range what about technic technical specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? we need it all . would say we should say dumber than the average person . we should go for the lowest denominator . high school educated . so so they need no technical experience to operate . how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no .
we need it all . would say we should say dumber than the average person . we should go for the lowest denominator . high school educated . so so they need no technical experience to operate . how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . and we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . so we said it needs to send messages to the t_v_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple like this . so if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes . t's channel , on-off button , volume , mute .
what do you finding device or , ho homing device . and like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? need we we need like homing device . because people really are looking for remote that's more high-tech . what if we gave it charger ? and on the charger , just like phone , like you get portable phone and it's got charger , and if you leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds the phone beeps for you . but you got base . do you think people'll really go for that though ? it's useful for the remote phone . would that add to our costs , wonder ?
need we we need like homing device . because people really are looking for remote that's more high-tech . what if we gave it charger ? and on the charger , just like phone , like you get portable phone and it's got charger , and if you leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds the phone beeps for you . but you got base . do you think people'll really go for that though ? it's useful for the remote phone . would that add to our costs , wonder ? would , because you'd have to develop base . if you have the base , you could start putting in charger and then you have different battery .
it's useful for the remote phone . would that add to our costs , wonder ? would , because you'd have to develop base . if you have the base , you could start putting in charger and then you have different battery . rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . we can make decision about that later . we'll still put that as point that we need to discuss . so that would include battery source power source rather . is it going to have charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? and we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that .
still fifteen minutes . do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? can we conceive of leaving them out ? on the remote itself ? like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . we definitely need those . how how , , how would you leave those out ? , , if you can like , if there's just way of leaving them out ? unless you could say the channel . people would find that too foreign .
like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . we definitely need those . how how , , how would you leave those out ? , , if you can like , if there's just way of leaving them out ? unless you could say the channel . people would find that too foreign . you definitely need . and also remember that in this day in age we need , , like hundred button , too . used to have remote that did not even go up past like fifty . so couldn't whenever got cable , had to get new t_v_ .
unless you could say the channel . people would find that too foreign . you definitely need . and also remember that in this day in age we need , , like hundred button , too . used to have remote that did not even go up past like fifty . so couldn't whenever got cable , had to get new t_v_ . it's when we get satellite . get your own remote , or digital cable . we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making that we can fit all of the that we want to on our budget . 'cause don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so the double .
audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? that that's fine just for the t_v_ . how often does the average user need to do that ? the other option is like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . and so it's like don't , . it's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and , and like on television like know living in los angeles it's tons of spanish network television if it has english sub-titles it's definitely helpful . couldn't we do through one button , something , menu button , that pops up with menu on the t_v_ that says , , audio , video , whatever , language , ? so we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons . that could be no you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons .
so we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons . that could be no you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . for the menus . channel is just up and down . and then add . something that looks mayb . such as , , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . so we just have it like add menu button then for the various things needed , including voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now included in the menu . in the middle perhaps . got an idea for design .
had something , but forgot . get out of here . let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . after this meeting we're gonna be sent questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . and then we're gonna have lunch break . and after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . i'm gonna put the minutes put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them . and i'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as . here's what we're each going to do . the i_d_ is going to work on the components concept , u_i_d_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching .
so trend watching . since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is important how our product looks . so we can go ahead and go to the next . so what they want . now customers want fancy versus functional . about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . so the customer is confused . they exactly what they want . they want us to tell them . they want everything , but simply .
and that's it . see if it's there . which one is it ? interface concepts , no ? interface concepts new . either refresh it , or it sh , didn't put it there . mine will always read copy of something or other . copied mine before sent it over . there we go . looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this .
interface concepts new . either refresh it , or it sh , didn't put it there . mine will always read copy of something or other . copied mine before sent it over . there we go . looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . if you wanna start the next slide . can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the left , if you see on on the sides of of the remote , you have the scroll down , so you have that option there . and then also there's the idea of the base . that's like an idea there .
it'll be copy of component design . that looks like it . so basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . so you press the button , it produces signal that's encoded specifically for that button . transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the t_v_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . so that being said next slide , . findings which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery contacts , integrated circuit which consists of diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and capacitator , all those basic things that make circuit function . fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . an l_e_d_ , which is light emitting diode , contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . next slide , .
certain restrictions do apply here though . latex , you can't do solar power with latex one . so , if they want some soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . double-curved , you can't do titanium . that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . and so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . have one more slide . no , didn't . the manufacturing division also has said that they have several types of chips and they've just developed sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise .
the base , . the base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ? the that's true . always feel like first wanna it looks like , before 'cause if it's something really really small , then it's harder to imagine base for it , that was quite substantial size standing up . and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the t_v_ . we need to decide , so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want and exactly it could be like this . it's not gonna be huge universal remote . what size battery and . the other thing is like even if it's got few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons . i'd , this one is really comfortable , like like the sides whatever , because but if we have the , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that .
two double a_s , for this size . but like , , if we get more complicated then it's gonna be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size . agree , it's either gonna be bigger with base or smaller with just battery like this guy . so we sh . smaller , without . alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? you wanna vote ? if we had locating device with the small one , that seems way more advanced . i'm i'm leaning in the direction of this bigger and the base . i'm away from the base .
we have lots of options . don't think wood is viable option . titanium was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then would probably lean away from that . what did you , go ahead . 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce chip , titanium will be more expensive . however , , we only wanna sell it for twenty five euro ? what would you recommend ? 'cause was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce few in titanium , make them rarity so to speak . that'll , exactly . the selling point , .
if this was successful remote , we might then produce higher end version of it , . so we wanna go for plastic , or what would you recommend for materials ? honestly i'd recommend like since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , i'd recommend soft like latex , because we could produce , how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . we could do one that fits in with the trends of the year so , because this year is all fruit , only knows why , we could do cherry cover for this year and then if next year is stripes or solids , they could come back . or we could like take off this . they could buy cases , , if they wanted . and buy the extra case . it's good to sell basic thing and then sell options . so we could do like hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start . the what the top face , ?
because the soft latex definitely is squishy . squishier than like , , just hard plastic . and what chip would we need for this guy ? how complicated are we gonna go with the voice activated , we could give it specific code , , remote missing . don't think we should do voice , we should just do the recognition for when it's lost , . 'cause that what it type of , , for voice activation would it be like certain term what we would say like , because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time . see i'm i'm strangely attracted to it , because know that's it's definitely gonna be big , because it's , , it's just so high-tech . my little sister got for christmas she got one of those key finders that's like key-ring , and you have to whistle in certain frequency for it to work . see that would just irritate me . and then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off .
no , we just want it to be finder . but then it . just , alright . but do can your can the department make , brilliant then . that would be like mid-class . so we don't actually have to go for , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's brand new chip . why not introduce it in this way ? and what size batteries , double , triple ? triple , it'll be lighter . could it run off of two they're more expensive though , too .
triple , it'll be lighter . could it run off of two they're more expensive though , too . more more come in package . that depends on what the energy is needed . , we could do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause the lithium batteries are doing quite most other electronic products , ? so they're more widely available now . and they also have longer battery life than most batteries . but if you only have to replace it every five years . that's good point . as long as we sell it with it .
in the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , which if we make it curved like hand like hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , that could be particularly useful . see what you mean . so scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? but we definitely if we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have labelled . like on the side of it . if it's just up and down volume or channel . if it's just up and down . but is that for which ? you could do some on both sides . do we have both sides ?
buttons wear off . just looking at examples , you just don't ever see the logo on button , it's always on the actual casing . there's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual the only problem is we're using latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , so was thinking instead of doing that what we could do is leave space for where the logo should be . but we want it to be seen . on the back ? but you don't but , , you don't see it . it visible visibility though 'cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery . we need it to be seen . the other option is , if you can see it but it's like if , it's like the second to last slide . find it again .
lot of those buttons are blue-based . and then if we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . yellow , like that idea . like if we like the one all the way on the left , you ca you can see it on your computer better . where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . so we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons . like the yellow illumination idea , very good . any other ideas or thoughts ? we all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so . ha hang on let me catch up .
there will be time for that later . 're gonna wrap this up . next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes , and here's what we're each of us going to do . the i_d_ is going to do the look and feel design , the u_i_d_ the user interface design . you're going to get lot of , , the final say on what buttons get put we'll all talk about it , but , that's what you're gonna do , ? and you're gonna do some product evaluation . and now , the i_d_ and u_i_d_ , you two are going to work together on prototype using modelling clay . and you should all be getting an email pretty soon . for very productive meeting .
i'd say single . single sounds good , 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute double . it's only actually the size of my hand . you did an awesome job . it is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed . good job , you . those are really good . alright what's next in our agenda ? we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with courtney . it's powerpoint presentation .
like does it feel good , like , physically . that's just for current trend . it doesn't really count , you . it was little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . but it's so we do have removable covers , ? then that's covered . and so we everybody have that ? she's got it . so , we're using the criteria for seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . it falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ?
are we going to indi say we individually rate what do you say ? true or false , easy to use . easy to use . i'd say two as . hello , we're . that's what say . at the moment , no . like no , it's very fashionable . me too , very chic . thi would give it one .
true or false , easy to use . easy to use . i'd say two as . hello , we're . that's what say . at the moment , no . like no , it's very fashionable . me too , very chic . thi would give it one . one , give it one .
imagine , since we don't have that . feel like it feels good . does it feel good ? the shape of it actually does . and it's it is very ergonomically designed . it's gonna be curved . it's gonna be thicker . i'll give it two . i'll give it one . what do you say ?
the shape of it actually does . and it's it is very ergonomically designed . it's gonna be curved . it's gonna be thicker . i'll give it two . i'll give it one . what do you say ? i'd say two . alright , average is two . is it technologically innovative ?
i'm taking over your job here . no , it's fine , you're you're project manager . and it does it have voice the phrase recognition on it ? we were able to do it with that chip . we could do it with the chip , yes . it wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , but that's because it's only two dimensions , really . and there's no way you can represent it on here . and we discussed that being included . then yes , then would isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? don' have the , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight .
we were able to do it with that chip . we could do it with the chip , yes . it wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , but that's because it's only two dimensions , really . and there's no way you can represent it on here . and we discussed that being included . then yes , then would isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? don' have the , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . and it doesn't cover anything other then t_v_ , so i'd probably give it three . even though it is for just t_v_ remote it's very advanced . but it is just t_v_ remote .
don' have the , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . and it doesn't cover anything other then t_v_ , so i'd probably give it three . even though it is for just t_v_ remote it's very advanced . but it is just t_v_ remote . i'd go for three or four on that one , so , let's go for three point five . three and an half . alright , and the last criteria is it is it , we've covered that with the trendy . squishy and fruity . so i'd give it two . it's just trendy , .
that's the push-button too , there . integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . we're really having just push-button interface . so we can just go . one for the top and then one for the one for each side . but it that just covers the type of button we're having . because we're not doing scroll on the side , it's still push-button . like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and push-buttons . she's what courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ? but we just have push .
let's call it . two or would it be three ? or three , because of one on each side and one on top . it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine . less than twenty nine even . and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no . they're special colour . they're they're special form , 'cause they're indented . and , they're special material . we're under cost then .
we just discuss it . who want who would like to go first ? we think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using t_v_ remote , initially . we didn't have whiteboard . and no internet . no , , that's good point . 'cause i'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision , . and how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? overall we did good job like we got to choose we had control over minus it being just merely t_v_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which like we .
how did you enjoy making the model , the prototype ? did you work together in there , and . no , there was there was scratching and fighting , but no . minus that one fight . my , and we've all been pretty congenial team here , . we hadn't had any ma fallings out . minus you being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? that's it's definitely strong one . the means , the whiteboard didn't work . and no internet .
that's it's definitely strong one . the means , the whiteboard didn't work . and no internet . have to knock that one down couple notches . and no internet . and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet . and the digital the digital pens were they were pretty . there's so much available . like it's information . really appreciated those , .
we are really gonna sell this . that looks and also has what want it to do technologically . and that's your brain taking over , wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , . if we all just went out and bought useful things , don't think that's not what technology . that's why don't like macs or apples , just 'cause look at it , and t's probably very good computer , but look at it , and i'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same . they look like they did when was in elementary school , and that's so old-fashioned to me . 'cause they're pretty and just like . the toronto district school would only use his macs with their kids . exactly , so associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad . just the mac font bothers me even .
just the mac font bothers me even . but do like ipods , go figure . no , ipods they want all those words for presentation , even the plugs . ipods are now quite trendy , and they come in different colours . how many people went out and bough nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates . anyway , so that is definitely at work . mine is amber . but the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for t_v_ only . didn't have phone 'til university . was like who's gonna buy remote just for the t_v_ unless they've lost theirs .
it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the t_v_ to actually pick up the signal . think lot of the time , remotes that come with t_v_ players and t_v_s and d_v_ players , like they aren't like an area that's put lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain . like it's very very like making stylish remote control would be very like easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . what so wh what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about ? something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control . so if you want , something that looks like something that makes you think what's this ? like this pen doesn't really look like pen , but it makes you think . so , that's bit vague . no do you think there's risk if it doesn't look like remote control , people won't see it as remote control and . suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product .
something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control . so if you want , something that looks like something that makes you think what's this ? like this pen doesn't really look like pen , but it makes you think . so , that's bit vague . no do you think there's risk if it doesn't look like remote control , people won't see it as remote control and . suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product . any other thoughts about the physical appearance of of remote controls ? something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things and they're awkward to hold onto , so something that's more comfortable that fits in person's hand better . the thing that immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and some quite fancy ones than the some from personal experience which look but aren't particularly comfortable . any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or yes , the only thing is if if you're watching television in in darkened room you need to be able to fi find the button buttons easily .
that would be good . so , andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to take over the entire the planet with ? especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . four million of , but if if we market it as as not as not this you you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks , is fashionable and like you just it's it's like it's one that rather than ra wan want rather than need relationship with the device , but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having device that they just looks , therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time . it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room but also device that is practically sound . so , we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both . , , an any any facets that we identify we aim need to aim for for all of . first thoughts on the the industrial design side . it's it's remote controls are unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much , but you don't it's you just assume they're always gonna work , you don't think of them as comp like computer can break down and you're kinda like fair enough there's all these complex things going on , it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually . they they just need to be very very dependable because people take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective , very always dependable .
especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . four million of , but if if we market it as as not as not this you you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks , is fashionable and like you just it's it's like it's one that rather than ra wan want rather than need relationship with the device , but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having device that they just looks , therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time . it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room but also device that is practically sound . so , we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both . , , an any any facets that we identify we aim need to aim for for all of . first thoughts on the the industrial design side . it's it's remote controls are unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much , but you don't it's you just assume they're always gonna work , you don't think of them as comp like computer can break down and you're kinda like fair enough there's all these complex things going on , it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually . they they just need to be very very dependable because people take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective , very always dependable . don't think we should make it too small 'cause it needs to it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller , it's just gonna end up under couch cushion somewhere and . but so yes dependable , and have good medium range size .
if you click on the the one that that looks like projection screen , no the one to the of that . these are functionality requirements from the our our down in the the research lab . took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what is needed by people and what they want to see . everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and . and general opinions about current current remotes . see that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . so some new style should be incorporated that's less ugly . along with looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . which is plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be more cost effective and we can put the price up . current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .
lined with numbered buttons and , , that's everything . who , have you have you finished there andy ? given that we've already had extensive discussion . do you want the cable ? let's see if make this work . you have to hit like function and something . is it doing . give it about twenty seconds , or so . there we go . so this is just about the technical functions .
let's see if make this work . you have to hit like function and something . is it doing . give it about twenty seconds , or so . there we go . so this is just about the technical functions . so the method , looked online of other similar products and then just was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have remote control do . and then there are two different kinds that found . there's user centred one and an engineering centred one which will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . so these are the two different ones .
which one does this plug into ? it's all there . 't did you could you see it on you screen when it that's not . alright , , so i'll just do my presentation on the working design . there we go . just at the the whole method of how the remote control works . the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ player or whatever . and it does this by , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages within the remote which will then be sent to the the television , the d_v_d_ to tell that what to do . and you need user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and the user interface is that's just you kn the sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . just general findings .
think that's good idea . that sounds pretty good , . is the , we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex external simplicity here . cut cost within the manufacturing and , if we have high tech interior , then then that that sh may be cost effective . do they make batteries that last that long ? 't think of anything off the top of my head , but there are certainly things that you buy . they usually have the little light source , what the heck they're called , the but , the little cells that . they have that little solar . som some do , but there are battery ones that are , permanently sealed . in i'd , , this needs going into the technology bit .
have one question . so are we doing just the television or are we doing so not d_v_d_ players , we , . we are doing just the television . that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given , no ? like in the email of television only . they're in the constraints email that got . didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ? that's one that's one sent you , which which was my interpretation of of the what came down from from head office . that's that that that that's their their view . so we can all give some thought to that for for the next meeting , very much .
like in the email of television only . they're in the constraints email that got . didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ? that's one that's one sent you , which which was my interpretation of of the what came down from from head office . that's that that that that's their their view . so we can all give some thought to that for for the next meeting , very much .
don't actually have any price information , no . and and do we know how long it'll take to develop custom chip . it lot longer than an off the shelf chip . we did the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , it's still still in an ex experimental form , so it would it's hard to predict the time . we need to make decision here . given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . now before we go round everybody else , does anybody have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ? have question about that . does it make difference if there are just few commands , if you can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say b_b_c_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have certain number of favourites and that . just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick .
have question about that . does it make difference if there are just few commands , if you can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say b_b_c_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have certain number of favourites and that . just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's the the world the the sky is your limit , but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working . then it doesn't matter . must say find it slightly surprising given that , , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . so for slightly different no , , it's if you you speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so bu the this this information is from is this is the internal company information , is it ? bits of it , . so , true , again but if it's without any without any price informations that's difficult to decide . mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , , hundred and fifty pounds .
bits of it , . so , true , again but if it's without any without any price informations that's difficult to decide . mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , , hundred and fifty pounds . yes , as . as opposed to the twenty euros , twenty five euros . also lots of mobile phones have got lot of technology in them , not just that , so . it's like it's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is . su if given that the the technology is not developed and and given that it's it's never been done before , the double risk , perhaps we ought to stick to to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present product that doesn't work . another thought , , go ahead . would was just gonna say mayb it sh like we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost .
it's fundament it it's something we've discussed since the the the beginning , so in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but that the the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so you have to . kinda we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then we should have it for the whole thing . and we've been talking about it the whole time . anyway , i'm i'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . from my presentation show , so . it should be , , so . no , that sounds good . it will have voice recognition if if that means if that means we can't afford buttons but second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as backup or just so that people can just sit there pressing buttons ? would say we do , .
would say we do , . did you want to say anything ? nope , that was it , that was it . shall we move rapidly on to kendra ? ra rapidly move the cable over . is it gonna work ? it's thinking about it . it'll get there . so did some research on the internet and what , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just variety of choices . findings , so lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just couple examples of different kinds that are little bit more unusual .
nope , that was it , that was it . shall we move rapidly on to kendra ? ra rapidly move the cable over . is it gonna work ? it's thinking about it . it'll get there . so did some research on the internet and what , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just variety of choices . findings , so lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just couple examples of different kinds that are little bit more unusual . there're some special ones available , like this one here , which is marketed towards children , different designs , and one of the things that we need to watch out for is v_ in volume because people some bring little picture of what ours could look like . so just minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also one of the things that people have used is slide button , like you have on mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator .
it's thinking about it . it'll get there . so did some research on the internet and what , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just variety of choices . findings , so lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just couple examples of different kinds that are little bit more unusual . there're some special ones available , like this one here , which is marketed towards children , different designs , and one of the things that we need to watch out for is v_ in volume because people some bring little picture of what ours could look like . so just minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also one of the things that people have used is slide button , like you have on mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator . if interrupt you . do you wanna say anything about slide controls ? the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable . they're they're about the same cost really .
just for the volume , . we could , . 'cause if , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , just the way it would , , . it's it's it , it it it seems to me that it it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , that there's no no possibility of confusing the two . i'm just gonna pass this along . so that's is that you want to say at the mo , fine . here we go . this is my report on trend watching . the data's come off internet from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . and we got reports from paris , milan on new fashions .
so we we're looking at sliders for both volume and channel change of one sort . was thinking just for the volume , but what what do you think ? just for the volume , . we could , . 'cause if , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , just the way it would , , . it's it's it , it it it seems to me that it it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , that there's no no possibility of confusing the two . i'm just gonna pass this along . so that's is that you want to say at the mo , fine . here we go . this is my report on trend watching .
also encourages to buy new covers and . , know the only the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it you've then got the connection and you've immediately got unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , , completely soldered together and it it it , total reliability , but you're saying and understand where you're coming from . just this as examples . so , that's true . or , but like like more than just the battery , like complete different like you've only got like , like this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip and this is the microphone . and then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees . and then , you probably are . if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about even if it costs slightly more than that , just building the whole thing in one , then having getting cheaper production costs and , giving people the option of buying new complete new thing , the advantage of replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have cover on , it will still work . then if , , if people lose the cover , they they might be nclined to go out and spend however many euros on on new one rather than complete new re remote . that that's just it with the covers , you're tricking into continuing to spend their money on our products without making feel like they're being ripped off having to buy new product .
this is fashionable . this is fashionable with . , i'm i'm i'm with it , i'm up to date . and , the the design that i've got , and and it could be home-made design , this says this is not just television remote control , this is , , fashion accessory . so the the the basic shape is is what we given that we've got one one on off button presumably , two buttons for channel change and one slider and nothing else , we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing . and , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and don't suggest we make it look like banana , but know the the organic , , curved look , , to deliberately get away from the , the the the the square look of most current remotes and , , whether whether the , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . or 'cause there's certainly , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently displayed so that people looked at it and say , that's real reaction remote control , want one of those . that we should make the whole thing yellow kinda thought with you'd have like yellow circle with the r_r_ in it somewhere on it , but i'd yellow seems bit of strong colour to make the ent like the thing no , but just like white or grey or black or some blah colour . the the or or , i'd i'd . no agree , we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently .
interchangeable case seems to be important to the concept . it it should be cheap , , if if we avoid any , , electrical connections . and , if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it to whatever they want , then this is new . we we whether that to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got good selection of covers that they can use anyway , and and if if we can keep them , , rolling , then , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to any of the famous supermarkets , won't mention any mention any names , it's it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better . and are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or . the that that's no , because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant . does actually , , . and especially for making them so like different and . different to feel , , . and the , that that solves one of the problems of of battery life , 'cause that would that would clobber the battery life , so no , given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually unnecessary .
the the the the the product . ll my presentation just now ? can get the cheers . more loud clicks in the microphone . there we go , . method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . so what i've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard gauge our team response to these questions . so , on scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false . seven being round number to work to . and then at the end just take an average yes .
i'd say definitely one . so and also technologically innovative ? yes the voice technology . easy to use ? don't see we could've made it any easier . suitable for the consumer ? it made we met all of the consumer wants . is it complicated ? doing pretty so far aren't we ? where are we ?
yes the voice technology . easy to use ? don't see we could've made it any easier . suitable for the consumer ? it made we met all of the consumer wants . is it complicated ? doing pretty so far aren't we ? where are we ? we've built in the the speech , where are you , function . does it take long to learn to use ?
don't see we could've made it any easier . suitable for the consumer ? it made we met all of the consumer wants . is it complicated ? doing pretty so far aren't we ? where are we ? we've built in the the speech , where are you , function . does it take long to learn to use ? no , not . and , what else ?
no , not . and , what else ? the r_s_i_ compares to the current standards , . less buttons so it must be . it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as . we we it was our it was we made an actual effort to will device appeal to all age groups ? it will because old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so and it's it's it's don't think we're actually charging particular premium anyway , in the end , so . that's good call , . had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the ease of use of the device might make up for that . it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but it should still appeal on certain level to everybody , .
just the simplicity of it and not having to learn to programme and not having million buttons . can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ? and what did we make the management's . in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions is that yes it it meets the requirement is it's television only , it's it's simple to use , it's it's it's within budget , it's yes an an any minor points we we we argue . under the cost . so we've done an amazing job in coming up with what need need calculator for that . so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one . and that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product . nick the cable back then .
so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one . and that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product . nick the cable back then . mixed up the colours little bit . do either of you want to say anything ? ps don't , we worked together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and , seemed to discuss things pretty and come to group consensus and . this this slide here the satisfaction with room for creativity , we've allowed ourselves as much creativity as the the the the product allows . won't comment on leadership , teamwork we've everybody's worked pretty together . we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , the results speak for itself and new ideas found , , again gi no given relatively everyday product , we've very very effectively come up with new new approach .
do not , it's just to try out the whiteboard . only animal could thin could draw . are we all gonna draw cat ? its bunny rabbit cat . you can tell it's not bunny rabbit by the ears . suppose it should have mouth as , , . and the characteristics ? the favourite characteristics of the cat the whiskers , because they're the easiest to draw . i'll give it some more , and the tail yes . since you're handy as , why don't you do yours next , steph .
its bunny rabbit cat . you can tell it's not bunny rabbit by the ears . suppose it should have mouth as , , . and the characteristics ? the favourite characteristics of the cat the whiskers , because they're the easiest to draw . i'll give it some more , and the tail yes . since you're handy as , why don't you do yours next , steph . it's to get us used to using the pen . it's not to test our artistic it's mouse . that's not mouse-y , no .
the favourite characteristics of the cat the whiskers , because they're the easiest to draw . i'll give it some more , and the tail yes . since you're handy as , why don't you do yours next , steph . it's to get us used to using the pen . it's not to test our artistic it's mouse . that's not mouse-y , no . no it's not mouse . not mouse , rat . that's it's clothes . it's ratty with with with very long tail .
are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? so , we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as . did miss something ? i'm afraid incorporated that when said who was present , but yes , we did , and we did little bit of team building of of making the pictures , but didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . so as group we've are they're accepting the minutes . accept the minutes . is that what we're supposed to say ? then we'll move to the three presentations . we need to move this . who wants to go first ?
three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and with the technologies improving , if we can get these . in real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? or eight million . but would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did know that it was it was an that's that's very good question . if speech recognition should be should be included , but it's an interesting that shows more about being open to technology . how i'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . it definitely needs lot more research on like how much more it would be and any , , existing examples , and what reactions to them have been , and that thing . shall go back ? expect an industrial designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve euros fifty , is that lot or little ? did not receive any information on that , but the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because there is question about do you want an screen and and that wasn't responded to , but some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , , so it turns into something perhaps you all have seen the osbournes where ozzy osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like small tray .
no , the chip composer sender . i'm i'm i'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , but . don't believe know , . what they cost . be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . it does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the which is the same as these existing models , just little bit more inspired , but just the same . although what what suddenly came into my head is , how they always take two a_a_ batteries which which is really not very efficient . could it be possible to have , , like rechargeable internal battery , like , , like an m_p_ three player does ? with that you could jus or mobile phone or whatever . you could , you just plug into power source for couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing a_a_ batteries , which are you'd never need batteries would .
definitely , 'cause i'm thinking in terms of the loss and breakage of remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having home , nest , place to live , exactly . have its little dock that you could put it in . so if you can dock it , , you could argue that this is exactly . and the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . still if it's quite within our price range . 'cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware . are we as to what our target group is though ? so that we'd be looking for the younger end . brought up some exactly , but you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? these are the , exactly .
usually put more money than brains . i'll make note of that , kate . good , good comment . because they probably live in household that has t_v_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , . it might be good to know who , , who's actually buying televisions and are we in region where people have more than one television in home ? we've got big hill to climb here , haven't we ? we've gotta persuade people who've got remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead . or do we make that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? we sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . that's probably more what it is .
which might , those are felt like had lot of charts . do you want the gizmo ? throw some light on that . actually we're , , we are almost half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing . my only comment is we could somehow include an enter key in like power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining . enter , power as sum simultaneous key . again , , thinking of menus or you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter so you press power after you've was thinking you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , and power follows something like channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . is that with you ? was miles away . how does that work ?
throw some light on that . actually we're , , we are almost half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing . my only comment is we could somehow include an enter key in like power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining . enter , power as sum simultaneous key . again , , thinking of menus or you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter so you press power after you've was thinking you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , and power follows something like channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . is that with you ? was miles away . how does that work ? was re was reading the chart to be honest . how so so how does that work , how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ?
then you'd have to have an off te off key . it's not getting bit complicated ? could granny do this , or are we just not aiming at granny ? that has turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . who's got an ipod then ? anyway , that was the only comment about some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important . it's definitely channel , volume , power . things like screen settings and audio settings , would generally do them on the actual television itself , like here you have , little flap with little control panel on the actual box itself . wouldn't know how to do it using remote control , so would say that they are definitely less relevant . for looking at that .
anyway , that was the only comment about some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important . it's definitely channel , volume , power . things like screen settings and audio settings , would generally do them on the actual television itself , like here you have , little flap with little control panel on the actual box itself . wouldn't know how to do it using remote control , so would say that they are definitely less relevant . for looking at that . so easy to use is the other thing that we want to be able to do . we don't wanna outsmart . as you said , , don't make it too hard for the granny . joined that set last week . first grandchild arrived .
we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , . is spongiest , . that would add . was thinking titanium myself . was thinking titanium , was thinking it's just have been influenced by pictures of ipods , and they're also minimalist and shiny . they are and they they would fulfil the first priority , which is fancy . many of us would associate those with fancy . something else we could do is call it something that's fruit and veg oriented . we could call it the name .
would be very simple product that would have spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as separate product . so that , , that might be and then we could keep it titanium . but it's pointless , isn't it ? would that be agreeable ? would it be helpful if described the components bit , because it would give you bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do . or possibly it might be more useful if kate went next . do you wanna be next or you want kate to go next ? we'll move the . you can even have them in different flavours as .
would it be helpful if described the components bit , because it would give you bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do . or possibly it might be more useful if kate went next . do you wanna be next or you want kate to go next ? we'll move the . you can even have them in different flavours as . so that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , . or or smelly . scratchy was really thinking lot about the the imac gel gem tone . scratch and sniff . it's hot on the streets , .
we'll move the . you can even have them in different flavours as . so that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , . or or smelly . scratchy was really thinking lot about the the imac gel gem tone . scratch and sniff . it's hot on the streets , . some of this you're gonna be little disappointed with some of the things have to tell you , but i'm afraid this is the real world . so i've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and i've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but i'm not that it's quite what you want . now this isn't very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of remote control .
i'm afraid don't have that information available . manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this , i'm afraid . because , what , i'm being quite serious when say that that the things mentioned are hot . but the important thing might be to choose one . if if what you're telling me is is some of these things aren't just aren't feasible , we could something about naming , we could call it , , blackberry . that's alright , let's see then . bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , so what had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with logo on it . but how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the real reaction company . it's just what i'd understood we'd be doing . that's before heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise .
there we go . don't have it on mine though . florence resolved it by eight again . if you do f_n_ eight again , it's it'll it , you you will do an . do it again . keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there , you get it yours without that one , and then you get it with both . should do it again ? this time it should come up both . don't actually have huge amount of different information then what kate says , just that my method was to look at the , , my my inspirations , which was big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use similar thing , including m_p_ three players , like , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . having think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece .
was thinking not actually scroll , like like mouse scroll , but , 't quite describe it . you see on the one on the , down at the bottom , is the mouse . see where the mouse is , like this style thing where you have up , down , left and . and enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one , it you can go into new menu for that . i'm getting bit specific here . really we'd have to use something to show you , but if don't think get it up on the screen . that's clean design , it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology . to make it . here we go . the ipod spinning wheel is really complicated .
and have it abstract . we could call like fruit name , but it would be little more abstract . that also is possible . we we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy . i'm just just throwing out ideas . just just something else need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on remote ? or call it or call it banana and have it in yellow . i'm thinking we need to be little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so . this is actually the volume up and down , but they both say v_ on them , which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like downward pointing arrow , but it's actually the v_ to indicate that it's the volume , so we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . but we wouldn't have specific volume up and down .

unfortunately don't have costing information . in terms of workability , the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , but i'm don't figures on the difference in cost . what's the feelings of the group on the kinetic ? i've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very handy , you don't even notice that it's there . i've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . sounds like it could be really good economical it would make the whole thing lot lighter , more convenient . it could tie in with the fanciful design as , , throw the banana , , just gotta keep it moving . 'cause it's really quite attractive thought , isn't it ? it's like , good selling point . so the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's possible .

curvature , is it to your liking ? see , the on-off's in the back . yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . if you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . and then you can use your thumb . and it was partly we thought the design looked better , but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in different place . could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having problem with the . you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid . like the fact that on both of them the keys play such prominent role . we really like we really like that design , it looks just like logo , that arrangement of the keys .
see , the on-off's in the back . yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . if you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . and then you can use your thumb . and it was partly we thought the design looked better , but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in different place . could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having problem with the . you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid . like the fact that on both of them the keys play such prominent role . we really like we really like that design , it looks just like logo , that arrangement of the keys . like like compass point , , just up , down , left and , and we think we could make that quite good feature .
and it's very simple design , there's not lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make . it's also in terms of being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different . have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to , this is really identifiable . the thing is we do need to develop our technology of actually how to program the menus and what , , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , but we do definitely think that it's viable option . the next item is evaluation . if that's if you're finished . shall take your power ? this is going to be heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . so , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by the consumers as as incorporate all of our insight into this evaluation exercise . so i'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and i've made list of criteria to look at , and so i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and i'm gonna now use the the board .
price of materials . we'll put price up at the top . not that we actually know anything about it , but we can we can pretend . will soon , unfortunately . so did you say ? so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? it depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when of fancy , of it's got lots of extra fripperies and , , like baroque curliness and which i'd call these quite minimalist , simple and plain , but do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , so in that respect it is quite fancy . yes , plain , simple , clean design . so in that respect we'll go with that respect . just we need different word other than fancy , i'd say aesthetic .
so let's let's take it to the next level . we'll just call it fancy then . so in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it e_f_ , do we do we think that perhaps and we should say the yellow ? should we go with the yellow in terms of that's really superior they're both . we we need to they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . so what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just purely blob or some abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved , like banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as banana , , with the grooves and the stalk and , so . that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . and of the two really like like the banana , but do like the chunk . so that's not something we have to decide just now , is it .
so that's false . that is false . good , designed buttons , intuitive buttons . better , more intuitive buttons , yes . people don't respond to ugly . sellable , quirky , , something people like , . they're different , aren't they ? is quite it is quite quirky . it could be quite good brand , like good little object . and was was thinking of other things in terms of could we say it's cost saving ?
with the , with the energy . we also need tho think about the energy . is it the kinetic energy ? if it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . it is going to be kinetic ? we'll we'll say it's cost saving enviro . but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely about that , but . you're still in the play-doh stage . including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ? our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop .
our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . we haven't got lot of expensive components in there . yes , the instinct says true . so true one or should go to two or three ? i'd put it at one , but , what do you , true , it might be the , , true . would say two , 'cause we still we need to get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . it's not just like it's not like ev , on normal chunky remote every button res means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . that's not cheap thing to get . that's good point . we need somebody to develop that .
i'd put it at one , but , what do you , true , it might be the , , true . would say two , 'cause we still we need to get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . it's not just like it's not like ev , on normal chunky remote every button res means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . that's not cheap thing to get . that's good point . we need somebody to develop that . anything else you can thing of ? and i'm gonna actually change couple of these so then i'm gonna instead of ugly i'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that 'cause have to do an average . and then excess buttons . just putting no excess buttons .
that was the crank , wind-up crank on the side . it's the wind-up . shoot , forget that . kinetic is and how many of those will we need per we only need one . electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . we can do it all with simple just checking that . simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest . and we only need one of those . the case will be uncurved and flat or single curve or double curve . it looks like it single curve , 'cause of the chunkiness .
whoops , don't want that , not yet . no , it just says push button interface . button supplements , they'll be in special colour of black . and the buttons wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? they'll be rubber , . so we need one of them . and are they any special form ? like the compass point one . actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not special material ? 'cause they can be plastic .
they'll be rubber , . so we need one of them . and are they any special form ? like the compass point one . actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not special material ? 'cause they can be plastic . 'cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . they could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got double curved case . they could be plastic . let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement .
there we are . that's the only excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . so , are they under twelve fifty ? yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide . the project process , satisfaction with , , the room for creativity . leadership , teamwork , means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that good things . , the play-doh was best , . 'cause it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , quite want this , but imagine it rounder . so much better just to go and , , this is it , this is what we want . so , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above .
that's what said , ice sculptures . one thing want to do is , the meeting's done . is that the end of the meeting ? believe that is the end of our meeting . one thing wa wanna do is save everything in the files , because don't think everything is saved .
yes , it's television remote control . believe should be taking minutes on this now . so , alright . the way that we're going to go about this is , , we'll have time where we can , come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in meeting and , and discuss what , what , what functional design we want to use . same with conceptual design and detailed design . so , , making that it , it's usable , that as , and that it's , it's feasible to create , and , to come up with concept of it want , what we want it to look like . is , is everyone , . got those notes . one thing that , , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . one of them is our whiteboard .
do come up . to go first . are we all doing it individually ? this is team-building time where , , , , my favourite animal , which changes all the time , , now it is an elk . let's stand up and support you . alright , so and it goes like it's got like big antlers , . vicious we have sheep . looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head . do you have elk where you come from ? we have moose and we have deer .
i'm bad at math . so now that , , that is underway , it is discussion time . so this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any suggestions that you may have so far , your personal experiences with remote controls , and , , areas you see that , , could be improved in your experience with them . does anyone have any initial thoughts ? find that in the dark it's often hard to button you're pushing . so what's something we could , , do to remedy that ? always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . it's always , where is the remote control ? so if you could have some tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . you can press button on your wall , signal , 'cause it always gets lost .
always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . it's always , where is the remote control ? so if you could have some tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . you can press button on your wall , signal , 'cause it always gets lost . do yous not find that , , like , there's lot of , , buttons on your remote control , and you what half of them do . that you don't use half of them . what they do . there's some remote controls where there's hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming . that's , that's , it is . so you just have like the number buttons , power button , t_v_ video button .
they would , you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . and that's the part that would allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . the user would return the product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . something like the case , if it's scratched , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . would we be the company that would break down these , or metals ? or would we contribute to another group ? you could we could probably empl employ , side company to do that for us . but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . for certain percentage at least .
or would we contribute to another group ? you could we could probably empl employ , side company to do that for us . but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . for certain percentage at least . not every , not hundred percent of everything we produce , but . this sounds like really idea . one thing we have to consider is our one hundred percent turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . you would have to hire number of people , and it might be more expensive . the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de deconstructed .
the one at the top . i'm the user user interface designer . the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . by taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . there're two functional design options . multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . and single function remote control , used specifically for the television . i'm , what was that last one . multifunctional and ch , see .
it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it compatible with different brands of devices . and it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , , other entertainment devices . d_v_d_s and v_c_r_ ? does everyone agree with this ? does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be better way to go ? was just wondering about the , what , what genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . and that would probably , , , ll what you said before about it being more profitable simplistic design . suppose having that would complicate it lot more . and limit the design . do you think ?
was just wondering about the , what , what genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . and that would probably , , , ll what you said before about it being more profitable simplistic design . suppose having that would complicate it lot more . and limit the design . do you think ? agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . and with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make more original design . we'll have more money to go into the design side of it . alright , , , are you ready for your presentation genevieve ? except you're not hooked up to the .
except you're not hooked up to the . i'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready . lost my microphone . no problem , we can i'm , what was that last thing that you just said ? so i'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . and i'll give you little briefing on what that means exactly . if you all remember from the email we got before our very first kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? the functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . so what i'll be talking about now is the equivalent for remote control . so what needs and desires are to be fulfilled .
tuning them in at the very start . if you get new t_v_ set , you tune in all the channels , do you do you think ? to get the reception and picture , suppose . so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . biggest frustrations of the people that we interviewed . remote controls are often lost somewhere . so that was already discussed by poppy . how we could have , an alarm system so that people can find it . takes too much time to learn how to use new remote control . so it should be very user-friendly , .
to get the reception and picture , suppose . so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . biggest frustrations of the people that we interviewed . remote controls are often lost somewhere . so that was already discussed by poppy . how we could have , an alarm system so that people can find it . takes too much time to learn how to use new remote control . so it should be very user-friendly , . people to do very quickly . remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ .
just , just screen , like computer screen . or like an alarm clock . you'd have an versus just , normal clock . what , what would appear on the screen ? have no idea still . just like an electronic screen . as opposed to just buttons . there would be like little , like on . on the remote . like on the top of cellphone , the the little screen .
have no idea still . just like an electronic screen . as opposed to just buttons . there would be like little , like on . on the remote . like on the top of cellphone , the the little screen . now that's , , exactly what exactly we'd put on there . the channel that you're on , the the volume setting . could it it it would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . but that would probably be .
we can do the there you go . i'm looking at looking at it now . come back screen . were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ? , we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but they were just saying that the teletext would not be used . alright , and another thing . this is for the design , the design of the product is that we wanna create , more of sense that people know that this is from our company . so , , all the remote controls must have our we'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . so , , perhaps our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . it doesn't have to be the colour of our of our company but , another thing is that , we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon .
, we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but they were just saying that the teletext would not be used . alright , and another thing . this is for the design , the design of the product is that we wanna create , more of sense that people know that this is from our company . so , , all the remote controls must have our we'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . so , , perhaps our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . it doesn't have to be the colour of our of our company but , another thing is that , we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . i'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting , wasn't offered , like type of logo or colour , so if that could be somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable . work on that . it's probably r_r_ in yellow . the little yellow thing ?
so no , no teletext , and no voice recognition . it would be annoying though if don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your t_v_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if you'd . but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , , know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous . so is it just . never heard of it . about other countries besides the u_k_ . do if anywhere else has it ? more research required , . but if was it management decision that we're having . it was management decision , so it's , it's out of our hands at this point .
on the buttons ? like the light up suggestion . that would be better . 'cause the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so would go for just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? it doesn't it could it could be tactile thing as . if if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . and there's something on it . like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . like raised that's true . and what we could do for , for channels .
it doesn't it could it could be tactile thing as . if if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . and there's something on it . like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . like raised that's true . and what we could do for , for channels . the numbers themselves . but then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing . could be raised . just little arrows , that you could feel , ?
thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is light up . and also , heather you mentioned before , like how it should be accessible to everybody . so like big buttons , for people you are visually impaired . the glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway . so like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody . that , that's good , . could we somehow we could , may , possibly , , incorporate them both so that the buttons could be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . 'cause don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , , like the actual soft plastic , , costs that much more than other colours . no , wouldn't say so . no , it's not these days .
do we have to decide what we're gonna do with this . the shape of the numbers is really good idea . and that's un unique as . for visually impaired , . haven't seen that . and as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just like painted on , printed . and it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , , , , better for people with els no what's it called , r_s_i_ , what was it that we were talking about ? repetitive strain injury . instead of like hard buttons . did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ?
repetitive strain injury . instead of like hard buttons . did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? if was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the real reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . like should we do both ? or we can have one or the other ? because it might , for , for our design purposes , , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has funny kinda colour . was gonna say , exactly . and it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with .
that would be good . or , or like mobile ph . and if we'd want to go with like t_v_ show themes . like bart simpson faceplate . and then that would be more profitable like as sideline to the remote as . could buy extra . you could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . that's good idea . that we should incorporate that . 'cause that wouldn't be very expensive .
where you manually charge up the power . like you wind up something . just every , every once in while ? just every once in while or constantly ? every once in while . it'd be strange to always be cranking it . it would be like going step back in time . don't would really be with cutting edge technology . whereas kinetic energy is new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work .
as far as know . it should be . we'll just say . yes , just why not . like the kinetic energy source idea . when people will , , be moving remote around lot . but that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic energy source . it could make an we could have any style . it wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and . just for environmental reasons .
do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it simplistic look . if we go with the design plate thing , we'll have to . just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , so and , and we might , , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons . but what about the lighting up effect ? you mean different colours for the lighting or . , , we had decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . and so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up . see what you're saying . so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . if they were white they would glow , probably .
i'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . so there would have to , have to be some parts transparent around the buttons , . and rubber is more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of . it should be able to . in the phone that was thinking of as , when you change the covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , , that contro control , are behind the rubber . so you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . 'cause it's just the wee control , , thing that's behind it . they , they insert over . so , we don't have to decide on one colour . each face could have its own colour of buttons ?
it might be more difficult to do . if they're , if they're sticking up . if it's flat then , like like on cellphone or mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to press down on these tiny little buttons , but . it would be possible . don't would make that much difference . the the dimensions of it . 'cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of mobile phone . you can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . and then you get to the circuit . don't would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing .
that means you're up . have shorter report for you today . it took while to get this , . you're not plugged in yet . that's very good point . so , this report is about trend-watching . so we can live up to our , our purpose of having very fashionable remote control . there we go . so , just so , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . also spoke with fashion experts in milan , new york and paris .
alright , given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions . so i'll need to hook up the powerpoint again . there you go . have you been saving your powerpoint presentations to the . didn't for the first one . but have now . but it's still around ? where do you have to save it to ? i'm just trying to make this pop up now . here we go .
we should just like take advantage of like using this to its full potential . it could even be one of our selling points . go for it . it could be fully kinetic energy . is everyone happy with that ? alright , the next decision is chip on print . don't exactly that means . it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . and that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so , it was so that was without the . and we were going for more simplistic style , ?
alright , the next decision is chip on print . don't exactly that means . it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . and that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so , it was so that was without the . and we were going for more simplistic style , ? so that means we're not doing the advanced . so it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons . we decided on the pushbuttons , ? so that's the simple . would we need more advanced one for the lighting , the interior lighting system ?
if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as . it's for the lighting , . does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ? so this is just like gonna be the very outer case , which we will decide on rubber . plastic and coated in rubber . plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable , interchangeable plates . plastic rubber coat . still going for that . user interface concept . this is your time to shine .
so this is just like gonna be the very outer case , which we will decide on rubber . plastic and coated in rubber . plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable , interchangeable plates . plastic rubber coat . still going for that . user interface concept . this is your time to shine . we decided on the component . i'm , i've lost my powerpoint thing , so 't remember what it's ca it's the component the command inter the command line interface . was called command interface .
plastic and coated in rubber . plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable , interchangeable plates . plastic rubber coat . still going for that . user interface concept . this is your time to shine . we decided on the component . i'm , i've lost my powerpoint thing , so 't remember what it's ca it's the component the command inter the command line interface . was called command interface . was it ouch .
so pretty just just the basic button functions . like if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have , . tone , contrast , and things . that's bit , it was minima , it wasn't the . that was on , one of my presentations . about how often it was used . do you remember that ? it was hardly ever used really . should bring it up ? that would be good .
got few slides , so show them . do you want to present it ? this is what we came up with . here we are . it's pretty simple design . it's based on mango ? and we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind . what was the where's the l_e_d_ ? it's in the middle of one of the little r_s . and then the other one is the power .
it's in the middle of one of the little r_s . and then the other one is the power . and we just have simple design . we wanted it all to be accessible from your thumb palm-held and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb . so it's palm-held . notice you have number ten button . so you don't have to that was mistake , wasn't it ? no , that's zero . you just need the nought . take that one off .
no , that's zero . you just need the nought . take that one off . was in charge of the numbers . and this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . so one plus one would be eleven , or because if you on your average remote , if you press one twice you just go to or say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . you can go one , three . you press that first and then you go one three . you press plus button ? i've never heard of that kind before .
i've never heard of that kind before . just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and so the plus and then . so if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . but would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? no no , all that's why we have all these numbers . these numbers these numbers all work independently up to nine . but if you press , it'll go to that channel away . 'cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . know , but if if wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if press the six it'll go to channel six , and then i'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ?
no you press the plus first . doesn't we haven't really would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , but she says plus press which what do you simpler ? don't mind , we can further define that . it wouldn't be problem . wouldn't have thought it'd be problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . but was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . but suppose it's not as snappy . the there is there's delay on remotes . where you can have it it's like five second input time . if you don't put it .
don't mind , we can further define that . it wouldn't be problem . wouldn't have thought it'd be problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . but was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . but suppose it's not as snappy . the there is there's delay on remotes . where you can have it it's like five second input time . if you don't put it . so as long as you hit them dada it should be fine . as long as there's not big pause between the hitting the two buttons .
so it's just like . so it's all accessible . we deci we went for like circular design for the numbers because we thought that's more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . without taking your hand off the remote . ergonomics are all considered . and it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as . ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . it could another type of repetitive stress injury though . but , no it's different movement so . and the feel of it , , we've made this out of play doh , which is representing the , , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness .
there you go . killed the five . killed the four . as for the colours , we were presented with limited range of colours for this prototype . it smells good . of play doh . but we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . or the combination . and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , or vanilla might be the most popular if it just blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all bit garish . 'cause it'd be quite subtle and .
we've been quite successful with the rubber coating and . the look is little bit more playful . that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . it's not your traditional . the colour has lot to do with it . the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that we would've necessarily chosen . it's not the sleek red , black and yellow , and orange . you were only given red and black ? so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . but if you can imagine that in like just pale metallic-y finish know t's for rubber .
so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . but if you can imagine that in like just pale metallic-y finish know t's for rubber . so we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . metallic-y finish we were thinking . diff if you can visualise this in colours it would look quite fancy . kinda like the potato look . it's very different . potato , mango , fruit and veg . we we were we were thinking about . the mango the mango look .
so know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . and the use of the rubber . use of the rubber , the use of the l_e_d_ . for the anti-r_s_i_ . the l_e_d_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's probably halfway . in some aspects it is , like we said . i'd say three . i'll go for three as . and it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . we want it simple .
one for that . it's you can't really get confused with that . there'll be we have to work out the number the plus system . the plus number thing . that's the only thing . but once that's figured out , it should be fine . and perhaps the turning on but . is this good-looking remote ? remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . again the colour comes into this .
is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? if the bottom was just flat , and then the rest is like round . but then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand . it would still be comfortable . thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly . we we could handle it . it could it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . that would be . it'd fall over all the time though . it'd be annoying .
you would though , 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes . it was another colour and it was like it'd look . gue , it's personal taste , but . would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , i'm not happy with those colours . so should we say two for that ? question number five . what's will people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product ? remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when remote control looked fancy . we have to market it in the way , that to say that it is simplistic . so people don't just see it and think , , this is so simplistic , don't want to spend twenty five euros .
make new one . but you're our marketing expert . they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? about ten pounds . but you don't have to buy batteries . so in the long term this can actually save you money . , that's true . so we'll market it that way too . so with good marketing scheme and the personalisation options , it'll . would give it two still though .
does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . so that was mainly that the statistics we said . it does very . because , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . and it's just you won't have to think about it . you don't have to look down to find them . they're clearly there , easy to use . the the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the video input and sound and . but they're not you and really . heather could you push it down ?
we have the alarm system . the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra it'll be again in the marketing . it lights on and , or flash as . but it's not obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't particularly see an alarm . the light from the inside was gonna light up . the light it will . or or was it gonna make noise ? but but both . but when the alarm's not . you press the button it makes noise ?
but but both . but when the alarm's not . you press the button it makes noise ? it turns into duck and starts quacking . that would be brilliant . i'd be tempted to . the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , , when it when it lights up as we it could light up when the alarm went . but if it was hidden underneath the cushion , there wouldn't be any point . so you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . it would have to be in the market but you still couldn't see it .
it turns into duck and starts quacking . that would be brilliant . i'd be tempted to . the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , , when it when it lights up as we it could light up when the alarm went . but if it was hidden underneath the cushion , there wouldn't be any point . so you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . it would have to be in the market but you still couldn't see it . though it was gonna make noise . alarm , but you can't see an alarm inside the alarm system itself . it would just be little speaker on the back .
the plus thing needs to be worked on . just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , that in itself makes it so much easier to use . do does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? so then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . so it's just like channel six , six , enter . that annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press why . but you don't have to press zeros . you could just press six enter , or one two enter . and or sixty six enter , that's probably more straightforward . and then like twelve , enter .
yes we did . now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? is the yellow . we we can't really do that because on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . it won't stand out . so it's not always gonna be the same colour . it sounds like the colour's something that we but the yell yellow's ugly though , depending on the so we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the r_r_ . the colours are yellow and grey . so it could be grey on the banana one . could be grey .
is the yellow . we we can't really do that because on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . it won't stand out . so it's not always gonna be the same colour . it sounds like the colour's something that we but the yell yellow's ugly though , depending on the so we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the r_r_ . the colours are yellow and grey . so it could be grey on the banana one . could be grey . we didn't even rea . this is the the factor that we've been least successful in confronting .
current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . would say so . following that briefing we did . but more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just naming it by fruit . with the with the colours . like the colour scheme names and . no , , are the plates interchangeable ? missed few they are ? so you can have banana and kiwi and . so that's something that's in the making too , like it'll become more .
yes we do . so wh what was gonna put for that ? two for fashion ? would say two . so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven is between . one point nine ? it's between one and two . between one and two . so that's pretty fantastic . close to two .
would say two . so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven is between . one point nine ? it's between one and two . between one and two . so that's pretty fantastic . close to two . that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . got , 'cause we've four to bring down . does that seem then ?
it's between one and two . between one and two . so that's pretty fantastic . close to two . that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . got , 'cause we've four to bring down . does that seem then ? it seems like it should be more around two . should've added five . do we have an online calculator ?
i'm attempting to do that now . it is one point nine . go heather pauls . alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . and my computer's frozen . and now it's not . so in our shared folder , if everyone could go there now , i'm going to steal cable . are you gonna do that ? it's it's it's an excel file . is that the project document ?
there we go . and have to access that as . it says it it just means that we can't add any more to it now . so far i've added what or what is going on ? it's blinking at me . it's locked for editing . i'm gonna open up second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . have the original in my my email account . is it locked 'cause i'm in it ? have you have you completed it ?
are we using that ? we should do it just for one kind . so it's like special colour 'll have two colours ? one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . so we can , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive . and we have special colour for the button , and we also have special form . and special material . and special material . which puts us just barely under budget . so our operating cost is twelve twenty euros .
'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork . so wh how we actually went round about doing it . alright so do you feel like there was room for creativity ? we were pushed . pushed for creativity ? we weren't really given lot of time , or materials , , to go about our design task . the ma or materials . so we could've done with bit more time . so it'd be like need more time and materials . but you were allowed creativity ?
we were pushed . pushed for creativity ? we weren't really given lot of time , or materials , , to go about our design task . the ma or materials . so we could've done with bit more time . so it'd be like need more time and materials . but you were allowed creativity ? so as like but you were supposed to have creativ . and the conceptual and functional . like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea , but when we can down to it .
we weren't really given lot of time , or materials , , to go about our design task . the ma or materials . so we could've done with bit more time . so it'd be like need more time and materials . but you were allowed creativity ? so as like but you were supposed to have creativ . and the conceptual and functional . like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea , but when we can down to it . were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . so that did limit creativity .
the computer programmes are good . it could be really straightforward for the computer . don't think there was anything . the only thing was having to remember to to tick the okays but was the only one who struggled with that . i'm actually not if i've saved my presentations . they'll probably still be there . new ideas found . don't really that means . i'm not , new ideas found . we've all learnt from each other , like the .
, universal remote . this is my first go-round with creating remote control , so we're all in the same boat here . one thing of with the remote control is you always lose . so if there's way of finding it quite easily , that'd be quite good quite good feature . ch like tracking device ? so we should we should set our remote control up to where it has like tracking device or or like it makes noise , there's button on the t_v_ that you press and . you can get those key you could whistle or make noise and it'd beep . generally , all remotes are quite similar in their appearance . do we want so they're kinda like long and rectangular . do we want something crazy ?
we want something new that's gonna stand out . lot more modern . modern so our remote should be . like user-friendly , like little , where you can use both hands , like little keyboard type thing . people , because people always tend to throw remote control about the place to one another if it was in ball , and the actual controls are inside . there are certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here . however one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , . what are we gonna build that thing out of ? how sturdy is it gonna be ? do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half year ?
so , so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , , if it were ball-shaped , then it . it could be cased on the outside and everything could be inside . so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , so our form and our function . we want it to be easy to find . what else it what else do we want it to to do ? so we want it to be universal . it's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five euros and , goals for profits are somewhere around fifty million euros , what they wanna make on it , so . also since we're partners of the international remote control association , we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . that's more on the research end , but the marketing . so marketing , , how marketing , you could find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there .
no no , . i'm your industrial designer , so , the point is that . you're the the industrial designer . the shape is perhaps not the most ideal . as as stable as it is , there must be compromise between stability and design here , so . suppose that things become design . but was trying to think of like the design of others . 't think of anything other than long rectangle for remote , small , fatter ones , but there's nothing being done out of left field , . it's not new , it's not innovative , it's , everybody does long remote because it's easy , it's it's stable . i'll draw something .
so that either way you're pointing it it would work . suppose you could do that . the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . more expensive and . course you can do that . it'll be evident after while or if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and , but it's rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it , you don't have to look at it , , which way around to point it . put it even if you designed it in some in way that , isn't rectangle , but still pointed in direction that had definite points . otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work . so if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , and there's your you kn which way you're gonna pointing it . to interrupt , but we have warning to finish .
what was it ? how do get it . to go to the next one ? you click on that guy . this is my report , which is going to be based on survey that was sent . gosh , i've no idea . just press the arrow keys . usually goes to it . actually need to see something else on my screen . hit eight again .
no want something else on mine . is that possible ? but you have to hit escape . and then you can . but now you don't have that . hit eight again . did the same thing . and then it should come up here shortly . so is there no way give you the slideshow and have something . give us the slideshow and something on your screen ?
is is it just just just using it . and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . and there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . and some of them it looks like barely need to be included . channel selection is used the most frequently . and then teletext was the next . volume and then power . and then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . so we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine lot of the functions into one button . the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so tracking device of some sort would be good idea .
having just listened to what corinne just said , i'll draw on some of the things as . some things that relevant to what wanna say . so i'm just gonna approach the technical functions design . the method used was to explore the technical functions of remote control . and simplest approach that came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . had some things sent to me . not very much . to look at similar devices . defined in some them .
focus on the the image of it . on something on the image of it . the the actual design . gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors which is what dictates the design the both the interface and the outer appearance because this is all the that needs to go in there . so unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me were too drunk to actually accomplish it , so i'm going to do lot of the on the board . just this is the basic basic premise of remote control . the basic function is to send messages to another system . so much is clear . an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like chip , that can compose messages . often in the form of infrared bits .
i'll i'll have look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break . do still needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . the ball is probably not good idea . and even something that's held like that might be difficult . so that it still has to be variation . on rect on rectangle but not necessarily as boring , as plain as rectangle . shall we shoot for specific target group ? that way we could if it were , if we were shooting for young then it's certain look to the remote . or girls or older people ? would that you think that would help us find specific form ?
that we would would wanna pick out ? if that might cope with like the trend-watching . find anything more on that . not yet but by the next meeting we'll have some info on that . so we know that the remote's gonna have to be we'll just say we've got colour scheme for it . yellow and yellow it's and bright , with the buttons being grey or black . and our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom or the . we could sketch so all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just rectangular sort . we could flare it . so it's more this will look like bone then .
suppose that you can have this . so was looking at trend-watching . unfortunately wasn't given too much information . was given brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . and then i'll just tell you some personal preferences that got from that . the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which we've already discussed before . the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . these are all things we've already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . and thirdly the remote would be easy to use . as far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .
that's what was thinking . those like , , spongy ones . you have one with flag , and one with banana and one that's spongy feel to it . so when you buy your remote you can buy various coverings . you can various covers . what's it called ? cust you personalised , . personalise your remote . we could leave that to the cover department . we all know they've got nothing to do all day .
that's industrial design for cranes , like that . makes sense , makes sense . notice the giant dog bone shape ? also good for animals . why's my screen crazy ? i'm going to bore you with couple of descriptions of the interior . just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the in there . i've more information on possible materials as . what we can and cannot do . but let's just for this to load up and i'll show you what we're talking about here .
i'm going to bore you with couple of descriptions of the interior . just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the in there . i've more information on possible materials as . what we can and cannot do . but let's just for this to load up and i'll show you what we're talking about here . the details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . the underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to row of further transistors and like that on the side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to infrared lamp which then shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal it's getting and will do what you tell it . so much for the the workings of the of the remote control itself . its job is to for you to press key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , that are received by the television . when you press key you complete specific connection .
fya don't have an information on that . however our company can provide us with with the titanium , so assume , i'm , was given an to use it . it certainly is an expensive material , i'm aware of that , but was given an . but there are certain restrictions to certain materials . now let's first go through the list with the materials . so we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . can also mix these . as for the energy source , we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . what we could use is , or what was offered , or what we could use , is basic bateer battery . we could use solar cells .
or you lose it , it lies behind the couch for week and . always the you but exactly . works arizona but in edinburgh not so no batteries are probably the way to go . the kinetic energy thing might work , but the same problem . you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . so i'd say what we're stuck with really is the basic battery . which also makes base station obsolete . we don't need that then . however our interface options are push-buttons . in which in the production of which or in manufacture of which our company is expert .
you can have an screen . but therefore no rubber will be used . so plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will influence the form . with plastic , as understand it , you can use any form . latex is tricky . or rubber and and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . so the way to go is if you want scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , add an screen , and then you can choose either plastic or titanium . or wood even . if you wanna make it particular shape , use plastic . add an screen , add scroll wheel , that'll be fine .
or the rubbery we cannot ? with rubber we could sh shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an screen . that's the tricky thing . could we not have shape with scroll and the screen , and then just that initial shape we had , just which is banana-esque . so that's thing if we did it yellow . and you just stick on just rubber things that that grip the thumb bit . they wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior . they wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . is that an option , plastic shell with rubbery coating on at certain spots ? certainly can be done yes .
certainly can be done yes . if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . like say just the underside or so then it can be done . so the fruit design how about affecting the surface of the actual remote control ? say we don't make it particular fruit shape , but give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . you name it . what about smell ? to the remote ? you could just sell it in different colours as suppose . in different ye yellows .
to the remote ? you could just sell it in different colours as suppose . in different ye yellows . bright citrus colours . don't suppose we have to stick to co stick to the colours . we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , that's yellow and grey . yellow and grey . yellow and grey . so what have we , lemon , banana , is grapefruit is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . would say , if were to make decision , would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance .
you could just sell it in different colours as suppose . in different ye yellows . bright citrus colours . don't suppose we have to stick to co stick to the colours . we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , that's yellow and grey . yellow and grey . yellow and grey . so what have we , lemon , banana , is grapefruit is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . would say , if were to make decision , would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer .
it's couple of couple of grey stripes . we could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . on the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey . it would look like banana just sitting on their table . there you go . rather than rather the holder , if we were to have holder , it could be shaped like fruit . it could and then you could actually put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was . could look like fruit bowl . it could be an ape . could be , it could be an ape or fruit bowl .
informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go . i'm gonna plug in here real quick . there you go . like said we have to make decision on couple of these items here . so is the two piece idea out ? or have we not decided ? rid of that because gonna use battery . and the base station might not be necessary . can still design two-piece remote without having base , having one of them be base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . we can still do that .
or have we not decided ? rid of that because gonna use battery . and the base station might not be necessary . can still design two-piece remote without having base , having one of them be base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . we can still do that . however this would be like designing two remotes . so which then , as understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . say like have scroll wheel and on both of them , or have an screen and so on so on . you'd probably have to stick rather with just traditional rubber button design which we saw there . but could be done , .
just little bit of . so we would , we would have the screen ? as long as the pla the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . so the case would be plastic , with perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . it's more of su it's more of supplement . more of lamination perhaps . so then for the scroll , are we going for the ipod type ? which will require more expensive chip-on-print ? so that , is that , is that about it ? so we have good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ?
as long as the pla the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . so the case would be plastic , with perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . it's more of su it's more of supplement . more of lamination perhaps . so then for the scroll , are we going for the ipod type ? which will require more expensive chip-on-print ? so that , is that , is that about it ? so we have good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ? so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . here's what's gonna be going on .
that's what we have there . plastic covered with rubber . we might add some more underneath here . give it , give it form . you're supposed to hold it like that , but just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so , you have some rub . doesn't make much make much difference . you could work left-handed or right-handed suppose . exactly , use both . might as think about think about the button as . the actual thing might be smaller .
just the on and off . it's quick on-off button . that's it's pretty important . so you don't have to fiddle with that . that's not i'd say bit smaller would probably be . you wanna play with that over there . there you go . it's it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy play-doh , but and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything suppose . would you like to done . with the scroll and the .
it's definitely different than anything else out there . so if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes would say , would say most definitely . it's it's curved . it still has your traditional black . it's not there's no sharp angles to it . i'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . however the colour , we don't have say in that . the colours detract little bit . some people might say it . that has been , that has been dictated by the company .
it's very intuitive , . that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had . give it one . do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? i'd say that so one ? 'cause we've we've brought it down to four controls most common , which are channel and volume . and then the other ones are just matter of just going , just scrolling further . scrolling through and selecting few . so that's one . the fourth one .
i'd say that so one ? 'cause we've we've brought it down to four controls most common , which are channel and volume . and then the other ones are just matter of just going , just scrolling further . scrolling through and selecting few . so that's one . the fourth one . how about the problem of remote being easily lost ? one of the number one complaints . something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it .
one of the number one complaints . something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . it's bright yellow . bright yellow's hard to lose . but if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . that , we could just use that solely for the the finding thing . that was what we'd we'd mentioned . so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could and it is quite bright and . just just to use , to find it when it was lost .
let's add one of those features and say yes . so we're back to one ? are we technologically innovative ? it's all just it's all just stolen technology when it comes down to . i'd say so . don't get many mo remote controls with screens on . it's stolen technology . it's but there's not lot of yellow , there's not lotta yellow . but we have . but for remotes .
it's all just it's all just stolen technology when it comes down to . i'd say so . don't get many mo remote controls with screens on . it's stolen technology . it's but there's not lot of yellow , there's not lotta yellow . but we have . but for remotes . course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour . fa 'cause it's stolen . that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth .
not so many . if we added the screaming factor then we go up . would say we're probably at four . that's gonna hurt us . you have that , , . we have some spongy , . as much as as needed , . it's not one though . one would be the whole thing to fold and . because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back .
possibly even five . i'd say we did . if your fashion is is carmen miranda , you betcha . more the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , but it definitely is . be what we were told , and they'd say , definitely . now we just gotta calculate . six eight twelve sixteen . seventeen divided by eight . seven is two point two point four ? is that some long division ?
haven't done math in years . just , i'm there's . we'll say two point four two . how does that look ? 't do that without calculator . no 't do long very impressive . it's been while . and what what is the acceptable criteria ? is there like scale that we have to hit ? they just told me to pick my own criteria and have you evaluate it .
they just told me to pick my own criteria and have you evaluate it . so that's that . now we get to do the budget numbers . you didn't know that you were gonna have budget . but we do . you'd been going long time dividing that . it's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . two point four two . we'll go with that . not too shabby .
double curved , yes . case materials are plastic . it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . is that or is it just one ? no that's just one . it's one because of the . it's just one mo single mould , we can do that . it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is . that's not special colour . it's specially ugly colour , but it's not special .
that is possible . we may not need it . there you go . there we go . there we go . twelve point five . so we just remove our screen here . make it bigger dial . easier to use . even easier to use then .
we did we did quite . just half day , you have remote . there you go . from the start of the day . we st we started off little little weak . we knew where we were going straight away . our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . room for creativity ? there was that .
which was the whiteboard and the pens . we've used the whiteboard . had some problem with the pen , but minus your have we have list of employees that you would like fired . minus your powerpoint fiasco . that's not my fault . that's the people work for that work for me , they've just heads are gonna roll , believe me . new ideas found ? yes for the remote . no not for technology . costs are within the budget .
i'm not fully updated about this shared folder . we'll have shared folder with documents that we can share . yes will then find out ho how it works . this seems to me , yes , some computer program but didn't find it yet . so , we'll come to that later . so , now we will try out the white-board we have here . so , would suggest , yes , we we should try to to draw on it and then should be smart some way . each of us is going . i'm not really how this works , but yes , good idea mael . for us it's just like normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down .
the dog doesn't have tail ? it's got tail then . bo both predators . the dogs have tail . so do cats . did you work out cord ? and you guessed cats without tail . will go without without it , ? it'll still not extend , ? it's not up to that .
and you guessed cats without tail . will go without without it , ? it'll still not extend , ? it's not up to that . there you go . so what favourite characteristics . dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . this is why you're the designer . and i'm marketing . yes , yes this is yes definitely horse .
it's not up to that . there you go . so what favourite characteristics . dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . this is why you're the designer . and i'm marketing . yes , yes this is yes definitely horse . so suppose it yes . you can put that . blue and black zebra .
dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . this is why you're the designer . and i'm marketing . yes , yes this is yes definitely horse . so suppose it yes . you can put that . blue and black zebra . can you can meet them in africa , . so ma matthew ? the very rare blue zebras .
so hope you have some space in your the horse of mael . you got lot of room here . you can probably reach . it's not for that . so what should draw ? he has already to do cat . this looks likes cat who has been driven over . and we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , ? yes , the moustache . that's that's definitely cat .
yes , the moustache . that's that's definitely cat . and they like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this . it's quite , relaxed situation . she has the small legs . it's very big rat . or very small cat . yes , this is certain some contribution to our project . and you , bird . which animal has not been drawn yet .
put it colours . it would help us . with different pen widths . it's shark now . so , yes , why not ? it's shark , . it's baby shark , it looks to me , it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ? now it's swordfish . you have some in in australia , ? i've never seen one , no .
now it's swordfish . you have some in in australia , ? i've never seen one , no . hope it still works . so , this this tool seemed to work . so if we need to spend time on that , actually but , exactly , . you should go for the next one it seems to me . let's continue to to the real . our project finance thing . when we are and when you are going to design we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product will be about twenty five euros , so when designing project also look at you mael , keep in mind people want to get the feeling this is twenty five euro project pr product .
i've never seen one , no . hope it still works . so , this this tool seemed to work . so if we need to spend time on that , actually but , exactly , . you should go for the next one it seems to me . let's continue to to the real . our project finance thing . when we are and when you are going to design we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product will be about twenty five euros , so when designing project also look at you mael , keep in mind people want to get the feeling this is twenty five euro project pr product . per remote control , ? more interesting for our company , profit aim , about fifty million euro .
and you are in the use user interface design . so just wanted to to be . and i'm the the industrial designer . because you very , actually , but . happy to meet you . it's very so just on your web page but not not face to face . and matthew , . and i'm nanne . are there some other very important things to to do , to specify in this first phase of of the project . so so like what ?
now we are looking for television things or i_p_ . personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up . but we can't really design that hasn't been invented yet . it's it's it's it's coming up , actually . the personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up . you two should should , , think this over espec what , what functionality . actually , , and first before designing the func thinking about the functionalities , we need to are the user requirements . let's let's take in that case you can you always hook up with someone who is providing that and , you you sell their product as as your product with them , . then if they need internet , then we would be able to to to propose something with t_v_ over i_p_ . but before , but we want to design new one .
the will present here agenda with with with with slides to you . as you can see here . so first just to mention will take notes of this meeting and will try to work them out and give them to you . i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too . so you are the secretary also . then hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . we will in minute we will start with them . we will see in which order we will handle them of . then will bring in some some some new requirements got from the account manager , try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have have com some discussion about it . about the functions and this meeting we should really try to reach decision about the target group and the functionality of the yes yes who are we going to to to sell this , the customers , yes .
the customers , . think that's that's important matter . that's the big question . so and then we will close this meeting and after this meeting we'll we'll have lunch . why anna can you do you have presentations ? no , don't . you don't have presentation ? you want table to to yes yes you can can just talk about it or you can use the whiteboard if necessary . talk about it but have no slides or anything . 've just been presented with some research we've done in small focus group so , hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in remote control .
why anna can you do you have presentations ? no , don't . you don't have presentation ? you want table to to yes yes you can can just talk about it or you can use the whiteboard if necessary . talk about it but have no slides or anything . 've just been presented with some research we've done in small focus group so , hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in remote control . it's probably can't email this to you , i've just got web page with some data on it . it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . seventy five seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent of users would spend more money when remote control would look fancy .
have an web page yes . yes , mayb you can can send an email to me later . so there's breakdown of how much they use the different functions on rem remote control . power and volume selection are only used few times within this per hour . channel selection is used hundred and sixty eight times and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . teletext is used fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . an interesting thing that this report has brought up is that fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to lot of users . yes yes , have that too . thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . it's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's too much time to learn .
that's what the report says . and then it's got demographic breakdown on should be able to actually , if email it to you now . you can disconnect it there no ? you can just just . then you can connect this one or this one . you can connect this one . all to your computer . so these are important numbers that matthew and need to take into account for our functional these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the both user interface and functional design . need to muck around with this . it's probably easier if you put it on yours and then i'll just email it to you .
yes , i'll just get this up . so that we don't do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech . potentially , even for interesti that would not work so . you wanna have both options . would it would be solution for when your remote control is lost , when it has speech recognition then then it doesn't matter where it is , my t's we should be in range , or it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . but the these are all quite fancy features i'm not whether we will we can make this for for twelve euro fi and fifty cents . would be no you can't . and we where the state of the art of speech recognition is , ? it depends like there is it's very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , . but it's quite noisy if there is the t_v_ shouting .
or does it know which one you want to use ? actually you could you could think of having you can have key which could tell it could go to the video thing but yo you you you still can't in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the v_c_r_ option and you could play it or you can also think about having like in few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have system where you have separate sitting setup box and you have something like you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and you can just when you come back you could just switch on that thing and watch program . in that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those functionalities . these are next generation functionalities . it's the next generation thing , but it is going to come in couple of years . yes , but it's it's already there , the hard disk recorders i've seen them in the shop . it's goi it's . so it's going to record your things and you and you you need the functionalities what you need in both video as as in the standard t_v_ thing . that's fair enough . but don't think we're trying to make universal remote here .
fi five min . 'cause we haven't talked about demographic and it's very important issue . so you you you can have keys like which are which are like so . too , so we don't change the original order of them but then the keys are more spacious , they don't look so there there is very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , four , four here five and six , so the keys can be it looks not very much cluttered but it looks for you don't have too many keys but you can have lot of options if you press on the to . now that the idea's clear . we should now try to decide on our target group . which is quite tricky . we're trying to get people to buy remote control wouldn't they already have remote control with their television when they buy one ? they have already one . so our our our remote control has to be better .
they have already one . so our our our remote control has to be better . but it's not going to have more functionality , 'cause it's only low market , it's cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on the look of it , the design of it but that's not big seller , if they're not just going to buy new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as . so i'm not how we can get people to buy this thing . many people said in your in in your research the appearance of the r_c_ is is important when they are buying one but . but why are they buying one in the first place ? so that will be about functionality . but if people are buying new remote control for functionality they'll buy universal remote . i've got friends who've got so many things they need universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . in that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality .
so that will be about functionality . but if people are buying new remote control for functionality they'll buy universal remote . i've got friends who've got so many things they need universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . in that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . so your you think we should go for more universal high-performance what do what do you think about what componen . we can't , with the price range . we we're not building universal remote , we're not building high end product . we have twelve point five euros per per r_c_ and with this now that chips are very cheaps and we can include it in our control some new new features . and but that's ye don't think is not necessary , for long term . if we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to screens and things like that which would drive the cost up lot .
we can't , with the price range . we we're not building universal remote , we're not building high end product . we have twelve point five euros per per r_c_ and with this now that chips are very cheaps and we can include it in our control some new new features . and but that's ye don't think is not necessary , for long term . if we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to screens and things like that which would drive the cost up lot . whether that's necessary . is the screen thi this could be this could be market because universal remote controls tend to be quite expensive . for universal remotes if you . and quite complicated to use , yes . so we can try to go in between , and offer product which is not as expensive and not as complicated but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than normal r_c_ because it has more it it is in some kind universal .
have presentation , i'm just making this i'll just email you this file , my presentation . the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here because it's really team project with team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's it's good . there is matthew . do presentation ready ? i'm just emailing it to you . so sent you the slides , you didn't see them ? so did you manage yes see him , good yes . it should've gone through to you . yes have it . so this is just presentation on the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment .
so did you manage yes see him , good yes . it should've gone through to you . yes have it . so this is just presentation on the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . can put this on ? so we have to work out way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . this is to do this will not remove my microphone . we used some focus group surveys which went through with you last time , the main results of that , and some research on the current design and fashion trends that are out there at the moment , and as part of this the important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . the most important by far was the look and feel of it . it needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there .
about the feeling yo . ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . spongy is the current texture , but there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile , so if we make it like furry or soft , that'll be something that sets it apart , rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . so as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . so going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables . going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . that's one way of looking at it . textured feel we just talked about . it's another way of doing that . so if it's part of the the changeable covers then may they can choose different texture , spongy one or soft one like that .
it's simple pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . we could insert one that could underlie several functions of exactly , for customizing and . so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card . where they do all the wi with with them actually . how cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things . so so we we should come to some decisions now about this . so understand when we want display we need expensive chip , but when we want scrolling wheel we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can implement several complicated or advanced features . exactly that's very good idea , we could have one main chip that could handle , it's called f_p_g_a_ chip , that could handle both like scrolling wheels as as and . so when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip . if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five euro .
also thinking , both if we had budget of twenty twenty euros , it will be , but . we need specific costings then . actually do two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . that's an excellent idea . yes wh when you make design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . that that would be very good idea . because now don't have price in in head but for next meeting i'm be able to do that . that's that's something which wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . if if you want to put wood wouldn't suggest for wood 'cause it's it's much easier to use plastic or rubber rather than wood . agree on that .
at the same time , it is more like it would be more interesting for people who are having this r_s_i_ and all problem . yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing . big keys may better for them actually and . agree , and not too too many keys . one i've had before , remote control we have at home is one that's actually got cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys . but then you have still have when you don't use it you have such an extent of your remote control which you don't use . so it's possible , whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are buttons you don't use that much . i've seen that before too . anoth another like it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath . so it's something like this , the model here you can put the keys .
yes come to that yes , whether that's possible , you can start evaluating their work somehow . it would be interesting if you could look for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition like that . this me designing way to evaluate it so thinking about how to set up test groups and things ? whether that's possible in the given time but as far as possible . so you two will be together working on on two prototypes and further instructions will be will be sent to you by by email . two or three prototypes ? one for like cost and the one with like higher-end so that then we can be easily comparing them or find compromise between both of them , that's how it is . and find compromise . let's call this to an end . so we are done for now .
whether that's possible in the given time but as far as possible . so you two will be together working on on two prototypes and further instructions will be will be sent to you by by email . two or three prototypes ? one for like cost and the one with like higher-end so that then we can be easily comparing them or find compromise between both of them , that's how it is . and find compromise . let's call this to an end . so we are done for now .
have to change the pen otherwise . will be completely different . they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . might be seat floor rather than person . put it back . and do you t's . jo's making faces at me . matthew is late again . probably an important man . so is important for him to be here .
no no no , this is single this this is model with just the t_v_ one . no no just , this is standard t_v_ one , we are not talking about that . so and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . the extra two are for having or giving an option for having more than one channel . and the other one is for the teletext you want to browse through from that . so it's it's very basic remote then , it's only . it's very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it that it and would cost us to build it about eight euros . seven , eight , ei eight euros . exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has quite conventional layout of buttons . so this one model and .
it's to do that . but but the screen is very an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be that that's true . actually when you are watching the t_v_ , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , , you want to and this gives protection to the actually , giving cover to that actually . gives protection because when it falls down it it is it is is is it gives protec it's more robust that way . yes , more robust . and you have very good chances . it's low weight . you have to see the the components we put inside is very low weight . so the the cost is actually bit more , it's it's it's sixteen francs . it sixteen euros .
part of that . so that takes it down to thirteen euros without the speech recognition . if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more some more keys if you want to it it should not be cluttering up everything . we should stick with number of keys because if we add too much then it's too locati . what's this one on the side ? that's for the it's l_e_d_ for indicating your battery and as as it's like blinking one you can keep it aside . like the shape of them , do like the the size and the the shape . be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , anna you can give our give us your yes . and we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two . evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at .
is that part of both of them or ? we can still discuss that . so , and together with evaluating this we we might come with new ideas adding things or removing of options because they are too expensive , but i've received framework which we can do this . did you have this this excel sheet ? no , this is these are the the the latest prices of our production production unit for several components , so we can see whether the the price is is within the twelve euro fifty cents . so we can start with this , , calling this one . so it's the pink . this is the first design . and the other one's green . so look and feel ?
look and feel . you already feel that . in in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , so would consider two or or may even one for feel . but that's just half , we should also consider look , and then it looks quite conventional . don't you agree ? on the scale it's between functional and fancy we're looking at , so . ma ma ma ma say say five it's my opinion , but what what four , four . will give it we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say . it though the look is fine but still will give four in that case . now we then we settle on four .
no no the battery has fallen down , that's . battery's low , isn't it the ink ? the that's the that that one ? no no it's not that , it's how to close battery . now it should be . no it's lost battery . no it's it would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors . it will not ri , . is there another battery there ? you got second ?
the that's the that that one ? no no it's not that , it's how to close battery . now it should be . no it's lost battery . no it's it would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors . it will not ri , . is there another battery there ? you got second ? won't be able to tell . yes , it it has .
won't be able to tell . yes , it it has . is that working ? did it come out ? because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard . so then then . and the other one ? it's slightly better , , it's hard to tell from just the plasticine , but . when we want to include i'm doubting about this this component . it it it it breaks in your , yes see , .
yes , it is the same shape . it's bas the same thing actually . you will be except that in this . and the makes it better . and you might have slight thing for to forward and , . so will say two . it's it's definitely more fancier than that one . would say two , three . so , consensus ? two or three ?
two or three ? two's good yes . looking like no but except for the design of the surf . the first one , not really muc . there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , ? the surf design . what what features are we actually including ? you should be rea no it's more of the feel . are we including like location thing like trying to find it ? there's nothing like that ?
got the screen . automatic speech recognition . is that in this one though ? is this 'cause this is the there were different options we discussed then , we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . no , we ha , eight euros . we just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget . so the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one ? actually we have to check again . and this one was sixteen euros . innovation for this one is two ?
it's two , would say two . un to be one what would do we nee actually , , don't see , one would would be without buttons , . why it is one . the speech recognition is very good innovation believe it , so give it one ? so we can put one . this this is it with the speech recognition ? it's using speech recognition , . gi given that that it works , then it's one . ease of use ? he is used to it act they are used to it actually .
so we can put one . this this is it with the speech recognition ? it's using speech recognition , . gi given that that it works , then it's one . ease of use ? he is used to it act they are used to it actually . so the first one is really standard , so everybody including our grandmothers can use it , ? so that's two for ease of use . here there may , though it has more functionality it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . the other one is quite easy , tho though .
it's using speech recognition , . gi given that that it works , then it's one . ease of use ? he is used to it act they are used to it actually . so the first one is really standard , so everybody including our grandmothers can use it , ? so that's two for ease of use . here there may , though it has more functionality it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . the other one is quite easy , tho though . it shouldn't be diffi , actually it will be but have reduced the keys actually you see . so three or four .
he is used to it act they are used to it actually . so the first one is really standard , so everybody including our grandmothers can use it , ? so that's two for ease of use . here there may , though it has more functionality it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . the other one is quite easy , tho though . it shouldn't be diffi , actually it will be but have reduced the keys actually you see . so three or four . one me we hope sometimes people get scared with the number of buttons . and there is like would say three . three or four ?
so that's two for ease of use . here there may , though it has more functionality it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . the other one is quite easy , tho though . it shouldn't be diffi , actually it will be but have reduced the keys actually you see . so three or four . one me we hope sometimes people get scared with the number of buttons . and there is like would say three . three or four ? three , would . three is fine with me .
so three's how goes to the target demographic . so we're we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? so twe twenty to forty , yes that's . no , this would would would give this model to the old people actually . so sh completely changed our demographic there , it's not part of the the funky young thing . exce except for the surfing shape . that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group , but we after this we can can consider , making this more attractive to to the demographic . if it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then imagine it being applying to the the demographic . that's it's still ye . 'cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add few things to it , .
and the demographics of it's it has more market actually . it's got the got the the toys in it , it's got the screen and . tha tha tha tha tha that's it's better , because of the screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the on the and on the . and if you want to target if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , for this audience we need the screen . so , the screen attracts , yes . because it , ma that's something to consider , yes , so . especially if we're gonna have an screen on low range product then that's good . wh what what no say two . i'd probably go with three again for that one . or even even one and two .
it says one point six , one point one point eight . the blue one spongy . see , yes . so the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five nine by five , one point eight ? just add it . three , six , seven . this one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two . four point four point two . but we still got very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway . we we must try to get them closer .
just add it . three , six , seven . this one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two . four point four point two . but we still got very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway . we we must try to get them closer . both in or we just have to choose . because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and when we to for this one we have to make it more cheap . t's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . that'll take us down to the budget .
it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely . either of them . yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , but , actually bu so this would be double curves ? they're both going to be not basic cases . plastic would be the material . the basic one , . is it zero franc ? special colour , now we leave it to the covers . so now we're either going button or l_c_d_s , display . yes , but now this is per per unit , this number of components .
special colour , now we leave it to the covers . so now we're either going button or l_c_d_s , display . yes , but now this is per per unit , this number of components . is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ? so it would need twelve buttons . we might need scroll wheel , , for that ? no but for this one it's twelve euro . no , for that one also . there are twelve ? so , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , yes .
so it would need twelve buttons . we might need scroll wheel , , for that ? no but for this one it's twelve euro . no , for that one also . there are twelve ? so , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , yes . so this comes to eighteen . and that's without any special button supplements . one scroll wheel you might need . so so but do you agree that thi yes yes i'm i'm no i'm no i'm not sh .
so , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , yes . so this comes to eighteen . and that's without any special button supplements . one scroll wheel you might need . so so but do you agree that thi yes yes i'm i'm no i'm no i'm not sh . so we'd have special colour , special form and special material on all of them . they're not just standard buttons . bad estimate , ? minute , it's not it's not double curved , it's single curved , ? because it's there is no like .
that makes seventeen . and what are just the bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you ? we have we haven't talk about , but that's no is very exp inexpensive believe but it is not in the list . we have more , we've got those the scroll wheel on the side and the sc . so had bad bad estimation . we've got scroll wheel for the volume don't we , or is it some other thing that's not on there . ho is this scroll wheel or is this button which can be pressed on two sides so for higher and lower ? no no no . we've only got five minutes left so we need to wrap it up pretty fast . yes , scroll wheel .
no no no . we've only got five minutes left so we need to wrap it up pretty fast . yes , scroll wheel . so this is even more than the than the cost you gave , the sixteen euros . so based on that , , where is the es sample speaker but still , it no we cannot , . that is the sample sensor and sample speaker . so we're we we could go for the for the for the for the for simple chip , but then we can't have the the speech recognition , yes ? we just need that actually . we need one . so so when we this would this would be cutting the speech recognition .
ca we are just when we just want to to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . so is it possible ? but that's seven basic buttons , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material . that'll be then we have have to ask the user to press it several times . no no , he he he . so the display is is three francs , three euros , by itself . and we don't want to to change that ? we we really want other otherwise we wouldn not get the market . or we could even replace them by buttons actually . otherwise you ha you have ve very normal thing like this .
and the chip . the chip's up there already . so we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there's no doubt about that . because sometimes whe when you watch the t_v_ , you have big display and you don't need one more in your hands ? i'm just asking . actually it depends , it depends what functionalities you want to add into it , if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you'll have display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two euros at least . unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the display . so we can get rid of it and then add couple of buttons . but , do we want that ? on the market point of view , .
we have to come to decision now , just we we what we just do is vote about the the display so yes . for the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the display , there's no way we can get it in there . you assume , you want democratic voyt vote , ? one man one vote . so who thinks the the disply display should be should be in it ? i'd like it to be in but 't see it happening . 't see it fitting in . but but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . we need to be . bu you're power voter veto anyway as project manager .
one man one vote . so who thinks the the disply display should be should be in it ? i'd like it to be in but 't see it happening . 't see it fitting in . but but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . we need to be . bu you're power voter veto anyway as project manager . know , but yes . have to make decision now , that's it . so having an display is just have very very limited amount of buttons .
i'd like it to be in but 't see it happening . 't see it fitting in . but but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . we need to be . bu you're power voter veto anyway as project manager . know , but yes . have to make decision now , that's it . so having an display is just have very very limited amount of buttons . is that acceptable ? ca can have can the functions be implement in an you've you you agree .
the speech recognition is out . because of the budget , . so are we back to the original one now , back to the first version ? which turns out to be on budget exactly , . with these new costings . so just look at forget that one and look at that one now . we just go for this one and that that now twelve euros is the is is the price , . my my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected . actually , we we we will not need the really expert designers because the amount , . so we can go back and talk to the suppliers and see if we can drive the prices down to add few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment .
not too many cables and . so welcome everyone . so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control . so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . just one thing . you said twenty-five minutes , but have something else to do , so gotta have another meeting soon , so you could hurry up bit it's true . have another meeting so if you could . you have another meeting soon ? so you have to be quick .
so you have to be quick . for the lawnmower project . so the the goal is to have remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . so the design step will be divided in three main points . first it will be the functional design . third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . so the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . and then we will move to conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what user interf interface we want and what are the different trend in user interface and like that . and then the desired devi design will consist in specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've made in the second point . so will now ask you which is very important for the design of new remote control for to each of us to to draw your favourite animal on the white board .
you have to imagine little bit . your animal is recorded so it's not lost . is this it's pretty . wha what is this strange beast ? is it beautiful ? is it monster ? these things did not exist . yes yes is it like that . is it better ? does have name ?
it's my cat . it's your cat . the name is caramel . olivier , do you want to go , but next time you'll do something i'm . and you i'm too short for the cables . next time concentrate . i'm bit short on cable . so what could draw ? draw like very simplified cow . if it looks like cow like what ?
he looks like bong . it it looks more like donkey would say . we will be finished this is it for for putting for logos , no . so hope that it helps you in the process of designing remote control . that's is there matter for new remote control ? let's move on . so here the financial objective of our project . that is to say to to have production cost lower than twelve point five euros and have selling price of twice that price in order to target profe profit of fifty million euros . if it's trendy , original fulfil the user needs . is it single device remote control or is it multi-device remote control ?
let's move on . so here the financial objective of our project . that is to say to to have production cost lower than twelve point five euros and have selling price of twice that price in order to target profe profit of fifty million euros . if it's trendy , original fulfil the user needs . is it single device remote control or is it multi-device remote control ? we have to discuss that point . this is not defined ? on you you can suggest points like this . so what what so we have to decide if it can control one device or multiple . so what's what are your ideas about that ?
we have to discuss that point . this is not defined ? on you you can suggest points like this . so what what so we have to decide if it can control one device or multiple . so what's what are your ideas about that ? have the your opinion from the marketing side ? do we sell other ? if if we bundle the remote control with something to sell then it could be single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy remote control from us . so if it selled by its own it it would rather be for multiple device . do you agree ?
we shouldn't have too many for my part . no , couldn not of any requirements now . if we don't have so many buttons could be . and do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? might be good idea . and do you have any any idea of the trend the trend in domain , what it shouldn't it should look like , or things like that ? something which is not squarey , not box . something like that , least fits in your hand . the basic requirement . fit in your hand , .
something which is not squarey , not box . something like that , least fits in your hand . the basic requirement . fit in your hand , . and also it have , it may be it may be important for the remote control to be to , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall . and we should have device . it is original because you can use it in your in your bath whereas the others can't . water-proof would be very original . havin having water-proof remote control so that the people can use it in their bath . that could be but , it is still something you have to buy and that is not very , mayb but we can bulk it with already this plastic thing and the waterproof as .
half an hour . anyway you will receive some messages . you eat it ? does it move ? but if it is still correctly we'll see .
it is possible . you put it on . it was somewhere in something like this . don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger ami . what do you have in short cut ? you have no over . there is nothing . there's no we have technical problem . let's go and check . i'll go and check .
you have no over . there is nothing . there's no we have technical problem . let's go and check . i'll go and check . otherwise , could you just describe by hand ? with the the whiteboard ? if you remember but that's . what we want here is remote control . so the question first of all what to control .
with the the whiteboard ? if you remember but that's . what we want here is remote control . so the question first of all what to control . so most people want to have remote for their hi-fi and t_v_ and like that . and but other people want also remotes for controlling and toys like robotic pets and little robots and and other people also want to have remotes for controlling whole house . so there's project called x_ house like that that does that , you can integrate your remote with computers . so there is one that is one thing . the other is the the finder feature by whistling or whatever . if you have the finder feature then you can also have at the same time as and general voice commands if you want .
like video tape goes forward , backwards , fast and . so special navigation , linear access , random access and there's fourth one no ? so the better now for special navigation ? for special navigation you might have t_v_ in the menu and you going to change ? then linear access then random access . and also parameter changing . so if there are common parameters we should put special buttons for that or we could have everything generic but there are lot of remotes on the market now and this is most of the almost everybody has this . and and voice command did you . voice command we could specify anything . we could assign any button command to any button , if we have enough processing power , so .
then linear access then random access . and also parameter changing . so if there are common parameters we should put special buttons for that or we could have everything generic but there are lot of remotes on the market now and this is most of the almost everybody has this . and and voice command did you . voice command we could specify anything . we could assign any button command to any button , if we have enough processing power , so . so that's that close your investigations ? not so far . we can have look at the user requirements with if open it . if you can open the is not here .
not so far . we can have look at the user requirements with if open it . if you can open the is not here . you can it's messenger no ? in which folder ? where did you put it ? short-cut to ami shared folder ? but it's not . you can send it to me by email . just to participant one .
this is this email . i'm designing the user interface . so switch slides when you whenever you ask , that will be more convenient . so , functional requirements . so you can you can go . so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled questionnaire ? and here have the results so you can see that seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more more , more kind . eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look to it's not good . so it's not in theory but say .
not many buttons , and and useable buttons . but what remote controls did you look at ? what task was it ? it was t_v_ ? most for most is t_v_ . but we it it seems that we are going to make t_v_ remote control according to new requirements received from the management bo will present them in the following . you can go so . so there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said they lost often the remote control in in the room so they want to have way to to to find it . to find it . and lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use new remote control .
it was t_v_ ? most for most is t_v_ . but we it it seems that we are going to make t_v_ remote control according to new requirements received from the management bo will present them in the following . you can go so . so there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said they lost often the remote control in in the room so they want to have way to to to find it . to find it . and lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use new remote control . so they want something really very simple and easy to use . and remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ . what is her other side ?
other side , yo wa your wrist . it become painful you can have tendonditis . did not knew that . if you also up on computer in strange position . so you we have to make it more ergonomic . have to say ha ha . it's your job . got message from microsoft . before that have some some some thing to say before we know that the user use lot their remote control to to change channel . and to to change volume selection of the and and not lot for setting for setting the the channels and thing things like that .
i'm just thinking of some thing . we want to have no , if this is good idea . we want to have general remote control for everything . no no no . we it seems that we no want to have t_v_ remote control . from the management board receive an email . cos it would be costly and and also it it would take more time to develop to have general generic remote control . it's not true . the the second claim that you put . that it would be too long to develop .
it's it's this just chip which does all the numerical numerical computation according to your display . and so for us this is quite easy . we just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface wants something and after that we just do the coding to and send that to to to the not the to the television . so for us this is quite easy . so this is quite easy . we just have to define the processing power that we need especially if we want to do some speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple . there is not that much constraints . this will think this will take more time to develop also . and but for standard one this is really easy . it's question of one month and so on no no no no , say standard standard remote control takes one month to to do that .
would say about eight months to have the first results . so it's bit long . one month for the standard one with button . even if we have display ? that this is really standard devices now . for speech recognition . so we can take this into account . so who would be good to go for like speech recognition ? but we don't have time to market . and also how much during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have but how many .
usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip . because we are it seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting . so you have any idea for powerful one that has good enough for do speech recognition . no it doesn't . we can we can look at the new requirement receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have . had question do you want to continue with your presenta ? is it you say that don't remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control . ask your question if you want . do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ? to to to keep in mind to access to that menu you should do something like that .
it's not intuitive first . you say that want , have six button . lot of people are if you have the screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure imagine so it's really something for the expert user . but , but also it seems that . so there are markets and markets . the young people are are christine here said you have it is . so for our young people it will be , they can be able to use it . their parents will not but they will configure it . if there is study about that . it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating simple product .
the channels change one by one . so you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense bit . that's good idea . also we have to decide so it should be lightening in the dark because most people lost their remote control . 's quite it's quite easy we do that with back light on the on the wheel . even if l_e_d_ or if if it's the feature whatever , . blue blue l_e_d_ and we sell that . and do we put an display ? because it was important for young customers if you remember . it's only put on if cou have multi function .
and did it it did work ? no it did not work . she send it to me by email . so this is better , to send it by email . what is your email ? so i'm it's in the first email so i'm participant one at ami where is that , it's here . at participant one . participant one at ami . so see you after lunch break . during lunch break actually .
switch slide on your request . only have three slides , so . look at the just this . on some web pages to find some documentation and remote control is , as mentioned previously , you just have very simple chip and the the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using wheel control . so was looking for that chip , which is very very standard , and looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . and we can change directly . have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . the push button are usually extremely cheap , but have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . and we if we could just talk about that if we really need wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . wheel sensor is fifty time the price of push button .
but that's all . you we an email from the manufacturing division that they have voice recognition chip already developed . it says that ri now they just use it to to record answers to particular questions . but it could be it's possible . and could it be adapted ? instead of recording the answers you can just record something simpler like command . and there can recognize some commands and ? you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and , so if they already have it as as chip then we we could use it . we can just listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . but it's , haven't written my personal references .
you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and , so if they already have it as as chip then we we could use it . we can just listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . but it's , haven't written my personal references . the want to mention the the problem of the the wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , and if we could reduce that . we we have already some good things with with the backlight of the push button . have question about that actually . what is the purpose of the light ? just to to make something which is slightly more design that squarey box with rubber . is but but in in the dark but is going to be always turned on , the light ? you can easily find the button in the dark or so ?
just to to make something which is slightly more design that squarey box with rubber . is but but in in the dark but is going to be always turned on , the light ? you can easily find the button in the dark or so ? it will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control , no ? but if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . you can see the buttons better , . but if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . as soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . but you need another sensor for that , ? no it's too expensive .
but you need another sensor for that , ? no it's too expensive . don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen very cheap devices but the bill starts to be first of all was thinking to have continuous light and you when you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device , little bit . but expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , . but it can be battery consuming , no ? to have the light always on ? will discuss that after the other presentations . so my one , it should be in the shared folder . it was last time saw it . and it is .
these are the basic thing . so it's only the central part . so , software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . with more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . if you have , that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . it could be on the side , . because we don't have these input buttons and this other that they have . and that the plastic cover is not very good idea because you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere bit out of the way . so that they're separate bit , .
so now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control . so , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . and the second aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative . and the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . so , are things we are we have speak about before . and so you you can go after . and there is fashion watchers in paris and milan that have detected the following trends , fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . so , if our remote control have to be fruit form or vegetable form something like that , or and the the material is expected to be spongy . support an apple . which material can be spongy , and if you .
it is good also to have spongy material , . you can throw it to the television . because it's robust . it's robust , . we could say that if you throw it , you have sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . when it takes shock . know that they do that for alarm clock also . an and and this you can you can say that . you ca you can go before , before , yes . and here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is technological innovative , and after the easy to use .
we have to make it look like fruit or vegetable . colour that remember some fruit , things like that . what about and for look and feel , what about piece of ice , with blue l_e_d_ inside ? the obvious thing is banana , . about pear , . the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and . and it's ergonomic as . the banana is also ergonomic . pear like that . or fruit like that .
the obvious thing is banana , . about pear , . the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and . and it's ergonomic as . the banana is also ergonomic . pear like that . or fruit like that . we can discuss that . is is there anything you want to add ? is there any fruit that is spongy ?
is there any fruit that is spongy ? we we can have like pear is good , fit , or banana as you told . something like that . but that's not in the trend . you can make it it's not hard , the metal . the trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . spongy is good because it it will be robust as . so , we can keep the wheel because it's easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is bit higher , and we also have to find , so , fruit like pear or banana wit any others idea you have . what fr fruit would you like to to control your t_v_ with ? odi banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .
we we can have like pear is good , fit , or banana as you told . something like that . but that's not in the trend . you can make it it's not hard , the metal . the trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . spongy is good because it it will be robust as . so , we can keep the wheel because it's easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is bit higher , and we also have to find , so , fruit like pear or banana wit any others idea you have . what fr fruit would you like to to control your t_v_ with ? odi banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then . banana , it's idea .
it's good design and it's innovative as then . we can keep the banana . and it will be very easy to find . you can put also vibrator inside . and everybody knows what is banana . if you if you start with fancy fruits and fra and tha , so so we will just use standard battery ? you can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . it's really really good point . hope the students of management die , but anyway . now who are recording this meeting ?
you can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . it's really really good point . hope the students of management die , but anyway . now who are recording this meeting ? it so one second . so we have to take some decision on this aspect . so , so for , for component , so we have to think about those aspects , . and the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . what do you mean by case ? it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .
it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . for me if we use spongy banana case , doesn't matter . want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it . that can be in inside in the structure . but the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to if it's spongy then it's going to move , ? so , it's going to be bend lot . so if we try to push the buttons , it you t's possible ? no it's possible . but no the button would be it it should be something odd shaped , with spongy cover . this is like the .
no it's possible . but no the button would be it it should be something odd shaped , with spongy cover . this is like the . odd shape with spongy cover . and standard battery , chip imprint , there's no specific problem . so we agree to put the wheel so it have to it has to be symmetrical . wheel on the top . button , where do we want some buttons ? usually hold , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , ? sa let's say that it has to be you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is also the thumb .
it's for both and left . should have the two sides . so if the left , we have the op wheel wheel buttons . you can turn it this way also . you can do both with both hands . the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . so you cannot see them . you you will get used to it . and moreover , the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the side , because you have light on buttons . so the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be know , but if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side .
so we are here for the detailed design meeting . so we will will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . then i've will also take notes during this meeting and will send you summary then as usual . we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work . and then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . then we will evaluate the product . and end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . so let's start with the cost aspect so so look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say to have standard battery , to have yellow banana shaped case with rubber material around it to be to feel spongy , and also at the different aspect like having wheel etcetera . and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros . so which is good , because we had price gap of twelve point five euros .
you can presen . between one and seven . so it's very very . give it give it five . what do you think ? so it's between one and seven ? seven is the highest ? seven is the . will give six . will give five .
seven is the . will give six . will give five . do you vote christine ? do you also vote ? no , want to see something . we all have to agree on common . we can very easily . and need to as . need to if you we ha we have to put one if it's better or uh-uh .
how much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? how much would you you don't answer to this questionnaire ? yes , six , it's good . five point five average . does it , techne technological aspect . so after , the technological aspect ? so we we said we have new technological thing with wheel . we have the wheel . we also have the rubber material , which make it like new also . would give five .
yes , six , it's good . five point five average . does it , techne technological aspect . so after , the technological aspect ? so we we said we have new technological thing with wheel . we have the wheel . we also have the rubber material , which make it like new also . would give five . four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . the rubber is four .
give seven , . would give would give seven as . it's very easy to use . six for me also . so six point five . six point five . six six six point five . is it fashion ? its its its fruit fruit shape . would say seven .
its its its fruit fruit shape . would say seven . and is very very design . it's fashion , because it's fruit , and we say that the , seven . we can we can put seven here . easy to find . easy to find in room ? lost my banana . you can't miss it . we can put six here .
lost my banana . you can't miss it . we can put six here . we have the lightning , or the lighting . we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but so it's yellow . so you'll make the material transparent so that it lights up completely , or . it's very easy to would say seven . it's hard to miss it . is it is it robust ? it's rubber , made of rubber , it's it's more rubber than other remote control .
it's rubber , made of rubber , it's it's more rubber than other remote control . it's ru it's rubber . the only problem there might be which know , if it's very sensitive , they will , , . but it is it is surrounded by rubber material . so we can put six . six or five . everybody is , six . six , , for me . we have to sum up everything . thirteen , twenty , twenty six point five , seven , thirty two , thirty six .
six , , for me . we have to sum up everything . thirteen , twenty , twenty six point five , seven , thirty two , thirty six . six is good , the be . if we say that seven it's it's the better , and when six sit six are good it's good product , . so six is so it's good evaluation , . so will become eight soon ? it's very promising . t's bit biased . we have good price and .
we will have much bigger project next time and much bigger salary as . all it depends on who watch this meeting . so good , so see you for next successful project .
so our our target here is to have some very like sleek look remote and we want it to be functional as , but one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here . we don't wanna big clunker . we want something that looks and it's fashionable and so that's fine . so you have this ? so we have three presentations , and we'll go in order of participant number here . so we can have look at the working design first from participant two . so so you all know me , i'm the industrial designer . but click it on off ? and we've some basic components that our remote is gonna need , just every remote'll need . we need some kinda of power power source .
don't have any figures now . we we have to until we get to more specific design phase for that . but and significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and the the the buttons and things like that , . that's all have really . and we have participant three , which believe is pedro . give you that to click on . and you wanna get view slide show , that's what you wanna do , ? when we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun . just go up to view . click , don't .
when we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun . just go up to view . click , don't . but what the the management recommendation was less that there's worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . this doesn't work . so function design . you know me , pedro , and what found is we want to do fashion and , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple and try to aim for design . if case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good . something cute and small . the big chunky remotes are died in the eighties .
don't understand that . so that might play on what we can do . the they're aiming at saying that you would use couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for the scheduling and the next programme and like that and now and now you can look it over internet . to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials . but still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . 'cause , , don't see the cross-over between computers and television . do see the cross-over in some sense , but but but but with the the remote is is used for television , . but it's not happen yet . you have digital t_v_ still already . so so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote .
but still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . 'cause , , don't see the cross-over between computers and television . do see the cross-over in some sense , but but but but with the the remote is is used for television , . but it's not happen yet . you have digital t_v_ still already . so so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote . unless you have . there there is on digital t_v_ systems you have you can press button and you can buy things in adverts , and you can you can view through catalogue . family member of mine has got system where you just you can , and there's other features on other systems where you can pause live t_v_ and things like that . they're just features from the internet from computers are are coming into the t_v_ under the covers , but you still use it through teletext .
we probably should . we we're doing alright for time . so that's just my question , but we can keep talking . that kinda cut into you there . no just would would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . as for , , the the case design i'll come up with more concrete ideas . now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small . i'm just thinking with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature that ar like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , , it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions . where the largest portion of the market is just gonna they lost their t_v_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their t_v_ . they want something that looks , that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it , that that it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that .
that's probably question more for for this guy here , . t's kinda both of us . us us user interface . that's 'cause and of voice-activated of of how many times i've i've lost my my remote and 't find it . so some way that find my remote by clapping my hands and and so so but this 's just something . was thinking about that . then your lights would go off , though . i'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ? what makes this thing attractive ? and it's only for televisions .
in terms of making it work or the cost of that or . don't all these things are pretty standard . onto participant four . for marketing marketing for me is and how do go here ? you can just click . no no no you just get off that . you just click anywhere . what for me is it what i'm marketing now , , 'til you spoke and when wrote this , what i'm marketing . know that was identified as we identified ourselves as as developer , as manufacturer , and as as distributor to other wholesalers . and so the the twenty-five euros that we've identified as the sale price is wholesale price rather than retail price .
but solar blah , like it . like cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , , replaceable batteries we'll just have power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . you never have to get go through the go through all these different batteries . and also you can it's good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as whole . you could have some neat little , , sexy design for cradle and the remote itself . like the idea , but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double . it it would increase the cost . but boy , we can sell this thing , because there's no batteries , it's environmentally sensitive , we can identify it as safer product in some form . and you could page the remote if you lose it . there's button on the cradle .
no no , we have we have to change the end cost . there's don't see it anyway . we we do we necessarily have to change the end cost because can we dl can we do that without changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we can sell more based on this ? that's gonna be up to these . my reaction is no , but , see see i'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . what do is look into ho pedro and look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers . we we can certainly push for more expensive product if that's gonna be nah , we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty euros , sixty euros . let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , high-tech design , ergonomics , all of this . just make this thing , , the the the rolls royce of of remote controls .
that's gonna be up to these . my reaction is no , but , see see i'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . what do is look into ho pedro and look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers . we we can certainly push for more expensive product if that's gonna be nah , we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty euros , sixty euros . let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , high-tech design , ergonomics , all of this . just make this thing , , the the the rolls royce of of remote controls . every home's got to have it . if you don't have one , what remote do you have ? you've got one of those , fantastic , want one of those too .
beca do not do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing handing us now . don't see it . don have to disagree though . our market niche is people who need who have lost their remote or who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , they just wanna run out to the store and get remote , and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . it does what they need . these aren't that it . and and to get to back to another point , for cutting in but , it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple t_v_s , , 'cause it's selling on its own . it's not going to be specifically for hitachi t_v_s or or whatever . no understand that . so technologically , if understand it , t_v_s t_v_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and d_v_d_ remotes .
we should keep it simple , medium-low cost mar cost area and make it look good . question have in in 'cause agree with you on , we gotta make it box . the box is gonna sell it , the outside , the casing . really need to wrap up now . can can can we have multiple designs ? have modern , have traditional , have , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have four or five different designs they can choose from . what that creates cost , or one over another . the the problem with that is we may end up with whole bunch of inventory of of poor design . , hear that . so but what we could do is some we we need to , , have few designs to look at and then come up with something that we all agree is , , the best fit .
doesn't matter , . i'm just jus talking about some something to make this thing unique . it that's the thing , i'm gonna keep thumping on . i'll sell whatever you design . don't have problem selling product , that's not the issue . give you ideas , you create the product . once you have the finished product i'll find way to sell it . don't worry about it . give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings . so just to touch on my point one last time that had brought up .
there is remote control watches , but they're sorta eighties thing , so it might not be easy to market in it but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now . they are not simple . those things may have been inexpensive for all know . one thing thought about when you were saying that , is that the our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken we gotta stop ? that's what was saying . who's lost or broken their their remote . gotta cut up . so how many remotes do they wanna buy ? can we can we sell them remote that can guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? and so with with with this system or locator , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ?
that's what was saying . who's lost or broken their their remote . gotta cut up . so how many remotes do they wanna buy ? can we can we sell them remote that can guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? and so with with with this system or locator , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ? how does this happen ? the last remote you'll ever buy . and also presumably they've exactly . and and then and then design the product , some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy .
we may do . can he get it all by himself this time ? i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly . he's getting retarded . alright got some exciting for you . just what needed was something exciting . remember , i'm an old man . ready to go ?
i'm feeling like big boy . pro probably not , 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . so believe fly . he's getting retarded . alright got some exciting for you . just what needed was something exciting . remember , i'm an old man . ready to go ? so we've got our conceptual design meeting . i'm old as .
i'll go first . what's components design . presented by name . my name is . jose he man is . your name is name ? my name is name . my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . did this in bit of rush .
presented by name . my name is . jose he man is . your name is name ? my name is name . my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . did this in bit of rush . prepare to die . so so here's look inside your really old-looking remote control .
my name is name . my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . did this in bit of rush . prepare to die . so so here's look inside your really old-looking remote control . you've got printed printed circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate we've all broken remote control . we've all broke remote control ri . i've love you tech , . so you've also got you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics .
battery versus cradle is . like the kinetic . so we have battery versus cradle it's actually novel thing because you could sell it as novelty , just to be actually serious for minute here , you could . figured you would . it could be fun . is it is more it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle . so our case design . we have choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . our material choices are plastic latex ty or plastic , rubber latex type thing , wood , or titanium . if we go with titanium we're gonna be limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and pers wood 't see anybody wanting to use wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , .
previous previous , . simple chip is required to operate push buttons . an advanced chip is required to to operate the display , and it didn't say specifically , but have hunch that regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels . that makes sense . that's the end of my presentation . so presentation from design would go best . technical functions or interface concept ? very long presentation . yes , but it has your name on it . that doesn't bo bode for it for it tats as .
very long presentation . yes , but it has your name on it . that doesn't bo bode for it for it tats as . so , somehow that thing's too big , but our manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . they say they could put it to work but we don't . it it it you'll be be affected by the by the other speech and and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore , and that's one of the things we wanna keep . if the t_v_ is working , . that's just it'll if somebody says up in the middle of television show , it's gonna change the channel . so then why don't you just press the up button ? but what if you actually had to press button to make it recognize ?
ye no it's not it's just four buttons that are on cross , so that you ba can control all of the important tasks from that alone . that's not scroll wheel . instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter . so we we go mid-sized , so something looks good and is not too prone to get lost . that be it . so on to functional requirements or trend watching ? trend watching has later date there . trend watching believe . forty six nineteen fifty seven . see what it looks like .
trend watching has later date there . trend watching believe . forty six nineteen fifty seven . see what it looks like . it's been so long . what to say . when when see the when see the product don't wanna buy it . see so many of out there . there's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there . are you talking about the picture ?
don't it's see it as different . don't say it's specially don't say it's special . say that it's different what i'm looking for as marketing is give me something different . give me lower price , give me higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's at the same price . need something to market about this thing . we're we're new firm . i'd i'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as , but wi with similar . what if when when we have when we when we have something like the cradle or give that's as as marketing standard need something to market , to make this product unique . the two big points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having the the actual design of the case itself having like this like rubber shell with plastic interior , having it look really and also be really durable . just remember when made up this report didn't have the information that we're discussing here .
wh wh what's the wh now what see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . t's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . but would we . so from marketing standpoint have have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique . if it creates something more complex or more expensive , then if that makes it marketing necessity . but again , from marketing perspective want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co it's very competitive market . what understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make . they are gonna be more expensive , but on the other hand , , it it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales it's worth it to do it , but would just use if was gonna do this would just use the scroll wheel for channels up and channels down . so like the idea of focusing the my personal preference is focusing the the product on the idea of the the case the the dock to put it in to to charge it . don't think volume or do you think volume would be no we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but .
we got some exclusivity in that , , we got something that nobody else has now , and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness . personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber . i'm thinking something like kinda almost like these pens , , where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like fused the plastic with rubber on the outside . just very thin sorta sheet for grip , sorta thing or for . no ma bit more then is on here but ju just as an inspiration , these pens are are or from from my perspective is mistake because this is universal remote and all you're doing it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not lot of information , , there . so then if we do we want to do anything more basic with the more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for buttons , or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go ? do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ? it's only t_v_ . it receives no information . so don't see any reason for having an 'cause it's an increased cost .
do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ? it's only t_v_ . it receives no information . so don't see any reason for having an 'cause it's an increased cost . unless you can think of something interesting to do with it . now there's now there's nothing coming out of the t_v_ to receive , so unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the cable box there's no don't see the , don't see the necessity of an either . don't see it . so the question is now we need to decide on you have to now go and figure out the details of this thing . so , what we need to terms of marketing and project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you can go and build this ? what what overall things have we not decided on ?
it's it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , believe , for me to market . again the push-buttons see are are everywhere . and so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in in broader market than if we go with something unique . the other thing about was , do we go to something like this ? make remote that doesn't look like remote . it's just another it's just an idea , and what see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , their their gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and . dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because , as far as durability it's not big when it's closed . this and what keep throwing out there keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different . but you are the ones that have to ultimately create the product within cost . and the question that you're being asked now is whether is the dock enough of unique feature to be able to go out and sell that as very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as ?
no it's just different . but we we will need receiver , an antenna . so it's just that's know personally that would be very attractive feature , is to have have button push to find my remote control . it should be really simple signal though so that's true . and it's presumably gonna need little speaker in it like that as to beep . but little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need quality , is it ? it's makes your living room more fresh as you watch . it'll be really cheap . or you can like have smell-o-rama , you push button and it puts out stink . we're doing for time here .
don't think the cost is justified for little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and don't t's obvious and natural how it would be used . we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , 'cause it's it it breaks down easier . for me the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but he does have point , it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that . but then that that surely depends little on the t_v_ because some t_v_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so if you've got scroll wheel and you you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the t_v_'s ability to to change channels . or do you have to go through and you for it ? you scroll it bunch of times and you for it to . wh what it would be is like like the like this , where it's digital wheel , , where it's where it's quantized into certain that was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be . that's where you see see what you're talking about now .
see so if if we had an up the top that just did number on it , ? no we could read it from the television . and then it that . you'd need display on the the thing . it'll tell you when you flip the channel on the t_v_ . the the television can tell you . no see what you're talking about . how would you program it though ? you just it's one extra button . you say programme start , and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you'll still have the keypad where you can type in manually .
you just it's one extra button . you say programme start , and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you'll still have the keypad where you can type in manually . put and then . so programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end . and and that just flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again . we have another another marketing tool . we have about three we have three or four things here . that's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . you could come up with partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply . and an we even have this as in-house technology .
i'm i'm with that . what want to me the next step is for these to come come in with the design proposal with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level . let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market to replace your t_v_ remote , how much would you pay for that ? we have to find cost . but you've gotta think who our target market is because i'm not our target market . i'm just asking you . i'm student , but on the other hand would think , with my project manager salary , would could probably afford this would buy it ? if then you could probably afford this . if had new t_v_ and this was looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which 's really idea , that would sell me on it little . do don't 'd go over hundred euro certainly , that would be way too much , but the would be happy paying over forty for it , , but not much .
we have to find cost . but you've gotta think who our target market is because i'm not our target market . i'm just asking you . i'm student , but on the other hand would think , with my project manager salary , would could probably afford this would buy it ? if then you could probably afford this . if had new t_v_ and this was looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which 's really idea , that would sell me on it little . do don't 'd go over hundred euro certainly , that would be way too much , but the would be happy paying over forty for it , , but not much . would say thirty five to forty . was gonna say thirty five to fifty . thirty five to fifty euros is our sales bracket .
if then you could probably afford this . if had new t_v_ and this was looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which 's really idea , that would sell me on it little . do don't 'd go over hundred euro certainly , that would be way too much , but the would be happy paying over forty for it , , but not much . would say thirty five to forty . was gonna say thirty five to fifty . thirty five to fifty euros is our sales bracket . so the question is what we ca we make it for . because one of one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television . it's one of the marketing features in this . that's why the scroll needs to be really robust .
bas that's that's easy . that's that's not , it's . 'cause we have about six , six , seven features in that alone . under the title of uniquenesses . the next meeting starts in thirty minutes , although does it ? it starts at three twenty one , the next meeting . so we've got more than thirty minutes . we've got more like fifty . have is my three twenty one is the next meeting ? the the ne next meeting is three twenty one .
the the ne next meeting is three twenty one . that's that's almost fifty minutes . they've they've changed the times from the presentations . you can you you can create all kinds of things . we'll let when we're done , if we can go earlier . so you will be getting your modelling done now and are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do , look like , how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in lot of detail ? if we have any questions we'll just email you . it everything's covered . this one was quite easy . coulda been worse .
if we have any questions we'll just email you . it everything's covered . this one was quite easy . coulda been worse . always the optimist . don't have any emails . this means go home . we all leave .
thi third third third . is it in who wants it ? three , three . the end product thingy . pedro can have it . like i'll help talk . so what we ended up with . production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and the research department , which is us , is fifteen point eight euros , someone forgot the units there , unit price unit production price cost thing . we implemented the basic functions , which is just t_v_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for the the channels , and we implemented the the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . zapping your favourite channels , ?
but i'm sh i'm open to to market this in either direction . but you came up with product , and at that cost it there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . the only limitations see to this is that we're focused on television only . that's the only that's the only drawback see to this . but with all of these other features people one thing i'm i'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . there's gonna be somebody going home and say sh this thing doesn't work for my d_v_d_ and my but like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . and we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . one of one of the thoughts that had is can can this unit be be produced in way that makes it upgradable ? like like sim card in in in telephone .
beep beep beep . do think we that we we don't need the events chip on print , we only need the the regular chip on print , so there may have been miscalculation in there . so we're down to sixteen point four , . and we and we have single-curved that it's single-curved , . is that single-curved rather than double-curved ? we're not entirely what single-curve versus double-cur you think ? we've got we've got curve and droop . but we save one euro that way , ? so we come bring it down to fifteen point four . see it's little bit more than single-curved .
we've got we've got curve and droop . but we save one euro that way , ? so we come bring it down to fifteen point four . see it's little bit more than single-curved . so it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it . do don't speak so it's in here , in that do we have any we have special form don't we ? but the the the we haven't talked about any special colour though don't if we're going for greys and silvers then don't think we're so we're push-button , scroll wheel , we're we have is this intended to be button as or just scroll ? it's that's not very special , it's pretty if . we don't it's scroll . it's not one of the scrolls where , , with this one you could push it down to be button ?
it's that's not very special , it's pretty if . we don't it's scroll . it's not one of the scrolls where , , with this one you could push it down to be button ? no we just use it as scroll . then we have fifteen point eight euros . it was pretty accurate estimate would say . it wasn't bad . so we're on to the we're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have look at the criterias that paul the criterion criteria that paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell how's it going ? 's frighteningly accurate . anyone got any thoughts ?
but the the the we haven't talked about any special colour though don't if we're going for greys and silvers then don't think we're so we're push-button , scroll wheel , we're we have is this intended to be button as or just scroll ? it's that's not very special , it's pretty if . we don't it's scroll . it's not one of the scrolls where , , with this one you could push it down to be button ? no we just use it as scroll . then we have fifteen point eight euros . it was pretty accurate estimate would say . it wasn't bad . so we're on to the we're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have look at the criterias that paul the criterion criteria that paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell how's it going ? 's frighteningly accurate .
no we just use it as scroll . then we have fifteen point eight euros . it was pretty accurate estimate would say . it wasn't bad . so we're on to the we're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have look at the criterias that paul the criterion criteria that paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell how's it going ? 's frighteningly accurate . anyone got any thoughts ? how how have we done today ? we did pretty . we did pretty too .
's frighteningly accurate . anyone got any thoughts ? how how have we done today ? we did pretty . we did pretty too . that looks pretty spectacular . no , we come up with with attractive marketable product and and concept . any other chang thoughts ? so what about room for creativity ? is it the .
we did pretty . we did pretty too . that looks pretty spectacular . no , we come up with with attractive marketable product and and concept . any other chang thoughts ? so what about room for creativity ? is it the . sh there was plenty of room . we we ended up being quite creative there . we got couple innovative couple innovative ideas .
is it the . sh there was plenty of room . we we ended up being quite creative there . we got couple innovative couple innovative ideas . we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we we still have the the teletext capability in this thing , we raised the price of it , we've added two new technology to it . so if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us . not every idea necessarily , it's still remote control . no but we did we did break with the specs little bit , but the leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? but like when say we have we had believe we have room for creativity 'cause this is we did it . no they were reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing .
keep it , keep it calm . no more pizza for me . so the the pen came in alright and it's little uncomfortable to use but it works . 'cause this is you were using it upside down . still that use them like that . that's our boss . nah , i'm i'm not convinced of that . i've been wor i've been wondering about day , but see these look like they're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . so that data might be slightly invalid . what new ideas have we found ?
still that use them like that . that's our boss . nah , i'm i'm not convinced of that . i've been wor i've been wondering about day , but see these look like they're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . so that data might be slightly invalid . what new ideas have we found ? wel had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the remote call feature . let's do both then . for the product ? we came up with quite bit .
so , then celebration as it says . free coke provided at the cafeteria . how that got there . who wrote that one ? so we need to close this meeting , bravo . i've got lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and . i've got lot of paperwork to catch up on too .
if we have to do it now , later later . so you can do it . so the selling price of the product will be twenty five euros . twenty five euros ? it's quite good price , . it's it's reasonable , quite . it's reasonable , , . and it will be an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve euros and fifty centimes . so , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your with the remote control . just be imaginative with remote const con controls , try to create something new and people would like to to buy .
it's quite good price , . it's it's reasonable , quite . it's reasonable , , . and it will be an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve euros and fifty centimes . so , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your with the remote control . just be imaginative with remote const con controls , try to create something new and people would like to to buy . and and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and suppose what you have to do . and you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications . hope so i_d_ is for the industrial design , ? those things just refer to each of each of us , .
and u_i_d_ , it's for the user interface designer , ? and marketing expert , it's me . you will be the manager . you can manage all this , . so you have questions ? so you all the parts of the work you have to do . so which you , the industrial designer . no i'm user interf i'm user interface design . am the industrial design , am the industrial designer so . so what's the difference between user interface design industrial design ?
so you all the parts of the work you have to do . so which you , the industrial designer . no i'm user interf i'm user interface design . am the industrial design , am the industrial designer so . so what's the difference between user interface design industrial design ? you have to know . you have to . it's your job , so hope you what it is . so the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will the relation between the user and the remote control so and the industrial design , it is how the object will look like . suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it .
you have to know . you have to . it's your job , so hope you what it is . so the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will the relation between the user and the remote control so and the industrial design , it is how the object will look like . suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it . so make user interface . you you de you implement the core functions in the use it . and you will transform it . industrial design's , it's the function design . so the materi .
product manager , let's go , will try . we should bring kemy here . kemy is really good at drawing . it's not matter so . you're going to draw ? it's the same as mine . it's it's cat . it's fat cat . it is not fat cat . it's the fat cat , .
just have to present project , discuss little bit about it . so we have break . we have twenty five minutes for the meeting . so , if you have questions . time is it ? we have an idea . have an idea of my job so so .
no no no . no you're no , i'm participant one . three three , it's three . did you save your presentation ? in one , . isn't that technical functions ? so you didn't save it . it's david jordan . alright , so david jordan ? so so i'll let david jordan do his presentation .
in one , . isn't that technical functions ? so you didn't save it . it's david jordan . alright , so david jordan ? so so i'll let david jordan do his presentation . no , no . this one doesn't want to be moved , . too for email then . the first will present the technical function design for user interface for our remote t_v_ control .
no , no . this one doesn't want to be moved , . too for email then . the first will present the technical function design for user interface for our remote t_v_ control . will focus on user interface design . so move to the next slide . as we know our remote rem remote t_v_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . there's lot of functions . over , over twelve or twenty functions of remote t_v_ control . so how can we design user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?
here , escape , , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , that it should be the same . it should , . so you have to the sh the user there the power off button it is something very international , that so . the user should know . such as the go on , go back and so , you will propose us something which is so powerful and easy to use . but the question is how to merge the google system to the system , alright . that's gonna be the trick . that's my job . that's your job it you , . that's my job .
do the requirements for the remote control ? twelve , nearly thirteen , . what the cost is ? for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have let's see . twelve , twelve half . you can move to the next slide , so . so the di the differen the findings what you find inside the re the the system here inside it is just , bulb and an infrared bulb , so here the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . that might just so . you can go to the next slide . have some pictures , here .
the avera the average prices that this technology will cost , , around eight euros , so . or at least , the you'd yes , you can . so what , the wireless remote control ? there's wire with remote control ? it's so so bres you have to decide how how you will , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or it's it's question that we can raise , so . we can think that , with the wire , , without wire . we can have both also . so you think that cable between the remote control and the t_v_ won't be good idea . no it wou it will be cheaper , may you making solu , but but as industrial designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? but this is what you would like to ask the user first and don't think the user would be ready to have don't think , , don't think he would , but in sense the wire ?
wireless remote control . but some pa always want to have , sometime want to have wire because . i'm just asking you . do you will be cheaper ? don't will be too much . could you answer ? have to think about the question , , 'cause it's that you can always wha wha with the wire it's cheaper but the wireless it's more practical , so . but the wireless problem is more the david jordan's problem . it's more your problem . mayb you have just to to research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .
don't will be too much . could you answer ? have to think about the question , , 'cause it's that you can always wha wha with the wire it's cheaper but the wireless it's more practical , so . but the wireless problem is more the david jordan's problem . it's more your problem . mayb you have just to to research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . that's my job . that's the now the . so so just think of the usability . but , it should be an agreement , , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the graphical user designer , but .
it's done , just . if we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , it would make it . so so , had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . so the first one is that for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's it's is no , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext . lame , or . so , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for for you your designing , you're not you won't be you won't had buttons to just to manipulate to control the recorder or the garage door or things like that . it's because if we want to to do remote control which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . we really want to focus on the remote control for the television . but there's balance between function and the cost . so it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .
this is , but this this mean that your t_v_ would be able to , , connect to internet , , surf the web . don't t's part of the remote control design anyway . not , but mayb so . it's more in browsing . there's that box in of it . pi there's that box in the t_v_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your t_v_ . it's it's not so popular now . it's pop don't t's popular , so that's the problem so . you had if you are designing remote control for the global usage , so if people don't have the technology . so everybody is with the new requirements ?
t_v_ remote control ? you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised . if you have like yellow ribbon here is the double . why you go it has to be fashion . or should be . doesn't need to be completely yellow , but just . so you have to . it has to be fashion and really be the image of the society . just when you enter you say , , it's real reaction . t's re reaction remote control , so .
or should be . doesn't need to be completely yellow , but just . so you have to . it has to be fashion and really be the image of the society . just when you enter you say , , it's real reaction . t's re reaction remote control , so . and also it has to be attractive , , because if you want to sale to sell the remote control . regarding the first line , what so we're just expecting no more use of the teletext . and that's it . but , but why , nobody's threat to me .
will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan . so , we'll technical accessoire ? no no no . so first will present the concept of user interface . there's three concepts in the user interface . so first one it's google controller . the second is fancy controller . the last one is intelligent controller . so there are three concepts in our controller . next will explain one by one , the first is google controller .
no no no . so first will present the concept of user interface . there's three concepts in the user interface . so first one it's google controller . the second is fancy controller . the last one is intelligent controller . so there are three concepts in our controller . next will explain one by one , the first is google controller . so want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . so it's combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions .
for limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very . but suppose you have family watching t_v_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you will work ? everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? but this this but this would never happen anyway . they cannot speak at the same time . but the but this . if you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite t_v_ programme , so they say channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , so . but but the same can happen even with it this remote control because the . it's very interesting . don't , , , you mean it could be problem for this .
no no no it's not that's that's not problem because you you don't have to wear microphone . it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . but where is the controller ? where is the controller ? it's in your family , in your home . no , but then it's it's like this . but we're here it's an object . but here you say you want to use technology . you can you can embed it microphone here . but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have remote control li like this , if you have an object .
or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? it we should give the flexibility to the user and we . you can see they can switch form one modality to another . it's bit risky risky . no , that's quite inter quite attractive . and it will be quite . but that , , switching from one country to to another will be problem , so although but , we should . if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . we should have confidence in technology . so , what do you think ?
we should have confidence in technology . so , what do you think ? we'll try the controllers you'd prefer . which controller would you prefer to use , you as remote control user ? if if , i'm if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . more features , . but if if if it like doubles no one would would be interested . but he need control that is very reliable , so . so it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the google controller or fancy controller . try to mix the google controller and the fancy controller ?
no , no , but you need you need new remote controller then . would would you replace your controller with controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that , you that's fun that's not the function of the controller , that's function of t_v_ . it's not really the we we can add some function like for browsing in internet , so like that . but user need don't have the the if we can send email from it . you can replace your t_v_ with new t_v_ with internet browsing function , but . because if you wanna browse internet or , , if you wanna type something , or no . but it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the t_v_ . because the the problem see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in family if and for all the person of the family , so , . but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to to use the controller , but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . but we want so , but we we want something that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .
you don't need to tune it . the goo you say we would we would to have google-like controller . if it's not too expensive too . because you have new ye . don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google . google is is simple , works fine , so if can have remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already lot . yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller . thi this , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . the then nn no . tha but the there's there's there's not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .
are you inst don't . it did didn't receive it . didn't receive it . record recorded directly on the computer . it seems that we have problem with the , so no , it will be more interesting to start with . if you remember what you had to say or it's more interesting what he says , . say it to you without . we can first come to to frahan . with frahan , then you can prepare your slides , then present it later . you will had some more information in it will be interesting after your presentation to have baba's presentation .
thi this is this would be like plastic-like , but rubber , mayb , , rubber-like device , so , tha tha that was the main point , , from the trend in fashion . pla very , rubber rubber desi , . so we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . so , as you say you want something technologically innovative , using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , will attract pro-ecology consumers . so when it's . it will be . cheap imprint so you you propose low level chips would be enough to have something working . so you think case . someth no wood . no wood but plastic ?
not no wood , but ma not the part you touching . would some we can have wood in the bottom and , . you it's it's natural . it depends on the design we want , so . it's natural and and it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , , saying that it's ecol , , it's not , so . the feeling is natural , so we can stay with wood . it's not exactly for the spongy point of view . but it's still fashion . but we could have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or . something that you can into it .
it's not exactly for the spongy point of view . but it's still fashion . but we could have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or . something that you can into it . and what about the user interface concept ? google and and fancy , how about the the voice ? google and fancy ? because that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . and we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how it it is an an interesting concept to see to have voice control . the smart controller .
no not really . i'm afraid thi this remote control will stay prototype . your judgement it's is biased . so whe where is the remote control ? so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production . so will let the our two designers talk about so their you have , . that is three .
so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting . so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba . so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production . so will let the our two designers talk about so their you have , . that is three . effectively one slide and we can discuss everything . so , this is our product or prototype . this is made by clay . the basic colour is yellow and red .
because mushroom was not in the trends . there was fruits . fruits and vegetables . but fruit and vegetable , so mushroom was mushroom ? mushroom is vegetable . so it's something eatable . we can it's veg vegetable , but we we integrated them with different colour . but anyway this is not mushroom anyway , so it's fine . we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable . this , , very enlighted colours , .
mushroom is vegetable . so it's something eatable . we can it's veg vegetable , but we we integrated them with different colour . but anyway this is not mushroom anyway , so it's fine . we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable . this , , very enlighted colours , . no , , . inspira inspiration is true . and inspired colour and and very sophisticated material , so . and so so what we what add is that , he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , , the chip , it is low level chip , and , we don't need to .
this , , very enlighted colours , . no , , . inspira inspiration is true . and inspired colour and and very sophisticated material , so . and so so what we what add is that , he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , , the chip , it is low level chip , and , we don't need to . no this our only two slides . so we cut it to see . wi the low level chips inside and the button and the the battery it is under . so where's the battery battery ? it is in in in the base , .
it is in in in the base , . in the base . in the basement . in the basement . and where is the solar solar cell ? but we say we sa we said solar . where is the solar cell ? this this this this is revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and don't , but it it's might be , so . do you won't be it won't cris increase the price ? we'll see after .
it might be . we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about we had three keys key points to for this remote control design , and first one was fancy look and feel . so we'll try to judge this feature with one to seven scale , one being no , . just let me check . so , four point three point five , it means it's acceptable . one one being true , and seven being false . so do we have fancy look and feel , according to you ? you have colours . don't the sha the bowl shape people like . but is it i'll agree it's unique , but is it really , fancy was was defined by fruit and vegetable look .
you have colours . don't the sha the bowl shape people like . but is it i'll agree it's unique , but is it really , fancy was was defined by fruit and vegetable look . the shape is unique , and the colour so it depend on how do you define fancy . is it really fancy ? but it's you have the lemon aspect of this this this thing . if you change if you take the buttons out , and do things like that it would be bet more like lemon ? do don't do that , . where the lemon is , but it's not obvious . it's it's this shape is lemon like , so .
do don't do that , . where the lemon is , but it's not obvious . it's it's this shape is lemon like , so . if , improving the texture of like having it less smooth or . because less button . so , my mush . looks like more fruit . but you don't have any button now . and , you have the finger here , with the buttons ? that's , is that that's good idea .
for turn turn the ball . have no idea , so . if you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . have no idea what if it is fancy or not . and where is the voice recognition ? it's embedded , your microphone . that's that's the second point . this there's two two functions . this is microphone array . first one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .
it's embedded , your microphone . that's that's the second point . this there's two two functions . this is microphone array . first one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . is it better like that ? no , the colour is , that's fine . so we can we can say the colour , is the colour acceptable ? looks , let's say it's pineapple now . so the shape now .
looks , let's say it's pineapple now . so the shape now . it's but would say there is more too much red . it looks like now you took it . it's too much red ? in the basement ? it looks like pineapple with cherry on top . so , from one to seven ? seven is the ma the maximum ? will give will i'll gi i'll give two or three .
it looks like pineapple with cherry on top . so , from one to seven ? seven is the ma the maximum ? will give will i'll gi i'll give two or three . no , seven is false and one is true . three , it's . three , will say three . three , three . three is fine for me . isn't it bitter like that ?
will give will i'll gi i'll give two or three . no , seven is false and one is true . three , it's . three , will say three . three , three . three is fine for me . isn't it bitter like that ? then let me the other criterion is is it technologically technologically in innovative . what other is it easy to use ? you said previously that you there's microphone inside an .
you said previously that you there's microphone inside an . this is microphone array , . it's micro array , . there four microphone . and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? so they they they they there's microphone array . so you can capture voice , you , so you can capture voice from different directions . and you can turn it so it's techno technologically innov innovative ? and you you've never seen rou round remote control , so it is , but see , you have microphone array embedded . bu but when you say technologically it's more , in the core , or single .
so they they they they there's microphone array . so you can capture voice , you , so you can capture voice from different directions . and you can turn it so it's techno technologically innov innovative ? and you you've never seen rou round remote control , so it is , but see , you have microphone array embedded . bu but when you say technologically it's more , in the core , or single . we have tactile buttons . you have that's good . no , that's good . and you have , this ki this solar receptor that , yes . that's another really good point .
two , , two . would say two . it's it's fine , so . it's better like that , isn't it ? now the most critical one . most , for the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . last one would like to judge is is it easy to use ? but it's just speaking . it's very easy . you just need the command .
but it's just speaking . it's very easy . you just need the command . but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the . you can use this in this way . this is the base . so you can turn to change the channel . but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? you just tu turn . if you he if you hear some click , it would , that's difficult .
you just tu turn . if you he if you hear some click , it would , that's difficult . like if you want to go from but imagine you i'm i'm no i'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , , one to twenty ? you take take the remote , so and you can turn like that to change the channel ? it's quite easy to so zapping , but it will be too fast . how can you go directly to twenty , ? that's dif that's difficult . no , no , no . if if it depend on the the angle you turn the if if this is channel one . but how you need to something that .
this has to stay on the table . this is just base . on flat place you can ye yes , . you can just . but then when you turn turn it just it's . no no , no . you can't put it out . it's just your turning from the base . you need to have everything in hand . if you want to turn , you can't use it and turn .
in each ball you have three three , three , . three three solar cells . so , electronic . single simple chip on print ? just one would be necessary ? simple , simple , . zero for the others . and sample sensor , sample speaker . as we have voice recognition , . so the case .
simple , simple , . zero for the others . and sample sensor , sample speaker . as we have voice recognition , . so the case . is it is sh it wooden . so we are all already nineteen . just keep on going , just to have an idea . the solar cell is too expensive . is yes wooden pl and that's there's no wood , so plastic just only , .
but what what about case ? uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . it's more like double curved . that's gonna be double curved , . double curve , , double curve . one , you have . but it's , rubber , . rather four buttons . no , interface . do we need special colour ?
that's special colours , . we have two special colours . we have four . we don no . it it's more like integrated scor . that this will be like scroll wheel , actually . tha that's wheel . you tu you turn you turn it , so , true . no no no , it . two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel .
the price is . we we have problem . we if we keep on adding things so we have to if if suppose if we change and we put just one ? one of the key point is solar cells . has it changed . it was stage one , so . no it did change , but just imagine we have . we have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . so you can transform the wood into plastic , . we have to delete the the sample sensor , .
one of the key point is solar cells . has it changed . it was stage one , so . no it did change , but just imagine we have . we have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . so you can transform the wood into plastic , . we have to delete the the sample sensor , . but we have you the the voice recognition , no ? but this one one of the feature we were not really . it's the one it's we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version .
that's one of the requirement . because we have red . red and yellow . red and yellow . we could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . we we can we can we yellow . black then is regular colour , so . so we need if we try to have pineapple bee . so push button then it's it's the next expensive one . an but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button .
we can transform the double curve into single . some single curve . but flat case , what's the ca and then one euro left . single curve should be fine , so . what it's it's bad idea , so . we have one . don't bat no battery , only solar cells . so we have one button , one wheel . there's problem with the push push button . we only need just one .
we have one . don't bat no battery , only solar cells . so we have one button , one wheel . there's problem with the push push button . we only need just one . so , you will have so one button , and scroll wheel with push button on it . one one scroll wheel , so and the vocal chord , it's fine . it it's fine . so so , . it's good they're not charging anything for that .
actually it's wrong . we're not under twelve euros and half . it's not written . sometimes it's under or equal . it's under or equal . it's fine , so it's fine , twelve fifty the solar cells , is is it ? so let's say wha what . which part is the most expensive part ? it's not cheaper . but it would be interesting for our marketing team , to make lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be but it will be technologically innova innovative , so .
we have just have to discuss if . , it's fine . this is my job . was it way to create your remote control ? it's it's good , to to create control instead of computer . find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end . and designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and and it was very informative for . and for the marketing guy ? tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , . 'cause we just presenting one is presenting his next one his and then we try to combine afterwards , so it .
it's it's good , to to create control instead of computer . find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end . and designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and and it was very informative for . and for the marketing guy ? tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , . 'cause we just presenting one is presenting his next one his and then we try to combine afterwards , so it . and new ideas about new products , , wi which would be fashion and and yellow . you can think about yellow t_v_ now after fruit t_v_ or . it can be an interesting , just lemon t_v_ it'd be yellow lemon . yes , just lemon .
it's really boring , . so you can you have base , triangle base so you the t_v_ you can . the lemon t_v_ with the pineapple remote control . that's that would be really interesting , actually . because the t_v_ you also . you could we could do fruit collection of electronics things . device devi the fruit ? but just don't trust too much the trends . 'cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years . la next year it will be insects .
and you can celebrate your leadership . mister david jordan . so it's yellow and very very ha it's very happy , so . it's party party remote control . it's it's pr it's like . the thing now is to to sell it . it's your job . , go and sell it . goo and good luck , so it should be fine . and the twelve fifty twelve twelve twenty five euros , .
so this one and this one . what do you choose ? prefer the laser remote control . what do you choose ? it's it's will enlight your house , your home and your t_v_ , so . next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside . that would be an idea . but that's going to be expensive , . we had some problems going to twelve euros and . it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and add some features to it after .
the spider has spider lives in web and it has eight legs , and it can move all about the web in two dimensions . unless it's three dimensional web which they have sometimes . there are some spiders that live in like that have like big ball of of web . and the other thing is some spiders can actually fly like they have they let out like stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like parachute so they can actually go and find new build new web somewhere else . so they did this in in charlotte's web that movie that little t's actually book first but at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . so , that's my animal . guillermo you want to ? why , but when was child wanted to be panther not pink panther , or yes . but don't you t's very difficult to draw panther ? so bad don't like it .
why , but when was child wanted to be panther not pink panther , or yes . but don't you t's very difficult to draw panther ? so bad don't like it . it would be very funny for us . it's friendly panther . it's happy 'cause it just ate someone . actually , honestly what's what's his it's be behaviour , if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female , have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt , so but like it because it's fast , and it's black as , so it can he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like powerful , strong , . watch film about black panther when was child and was in that age when everything was shocking me lot . so you don't like pink panthers ? this lapel is coming out once in while .
this lapel is coming out once in while . it's not very strong . so , not the favourite animal , but i'll draw elephant . i'll try to draw elephant . so , elephant goes like this , and then it has four feet . whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but this is the easiest . and then we have it's trunk . and something like this . an eye , cute . so and sometimes they have hump .
there are two , they are very different , indian and african elephants . so indian elephant is having one bump , , and the african have two . and then there's difference in the trunk of the animals , these elephants who are indian and so at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one do we have some message there ? we have to have to catch you , . some other time . we have to to go through the meeting . we can discuss that off-line . we'll discuss fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants . so so another important part of the project is about money , and about so about finances . so we should target selling price of twenty-five euro for this remote control and we have which which would generate profit of of fifty million euros , .
we have to have to catch you , . some other time . we have to to go through the meeting . we can discuss that off-line . we'll discuss fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants . so so another important part of the project is about money , and about so about finances . so we should target selling price of twenty-five euro for this remote control and we have which which would generate profit of of fifty million euros , . and we should target the inter an international market . so could ask one question , is this stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? so it's gonna be you already have t_v_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it ?
this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly , so let's go to it . so we should decide which remote control we want to we want to we want to go . should be should should it be specific remote control to some specific device ? should it be universal one ? so so i'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go . so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , which seems to little strange if we what the the product is yet , but if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so , we're gonna need to find out what's actually , what people ar are willing to pay for what product they're expecting for twenty-five euro because it seems quite lot for remote control , so it's . this is more job to our market person . so it should be the topic of of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and in which direction we should go . so we need to close the meeting . we'll have new meeting soon and so the work every every of you ha have to do .
so , this is . they are the most t_v_ watcher . so we should be careful . this is more question of of this is more question of of look and feel . but it because if the product will be international should start . something that should be addressed later . we should we should go to other for the other topics . that's the thing . we need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on . so let's stick to man mando for the name and we'll see for the for the look and feel later .
should be in participant four . so will will give brief outline about what what prepared for this meeting . for the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements . prepare marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . and also di did study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five , ten years . there is no no significant difference between the the the first new controls and . sh next slide ? more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . so and they they admit that the the they should they would spend more money in fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point . also the people are worried about about the r_s_i_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not with not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old .
more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . so and they they admit that the the they should they would spend more money in fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point . also the people are worried about about the r_s_i_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not with not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old . so people are are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control . they are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so it would be good point to to to to find solution to any beep any alarm incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost . and also found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control . so in my opinion the mando this mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like the the liklier it is to get lost . liklier or more likely ? people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who which are not very use like memorising channels or or this actions which are not very often but they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the in the remote cont in the remote control . also the the design should fit the hand shape .
the first and the third point , they are clashing . can still be , you can still extend past the hand . like , like no no was thinking of so like something . so fitting the hand doesn't mean much then . means like , this remote here is is very thin and long so instead of having you might have it bit bigger or , , with some some finger molds . so it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ? little sleek , longer ? and it should fit the hand . something with the shape of the palm ? some finger grips .
some finger grips . you could even have some buttons like on the sides and everything , but . on the sides . it sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical . and then finally . and finally , the incorporation of or speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but if the budget would be large enough . first i'm just wondering about the because because , so it's good time for me to to bring you to some new new informations . but most of most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this technology . we had the new requirements from the so from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to they would like to be restricted to t_v_ . if you had this information already .
yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough . we we can target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc . wh imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into into the remote control . no it it could be little it could be . so it could be few centimetres . one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is when you want to sell into other markets , though , because , i'm not exactly where we're gonna sell this , but presume it's not gonna just be english speaking countries . so then you have to , you have to train models for . it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so d_t_w_ could be which is the easiest . so you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having model which has to be trained and being micro-controller . we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this slide .
that's good point . what's what cou what could be the cost of , could we fit the the targets in terms of cost if we go to on the remote control ? it's not possible . but but , it would be good to there is any leverage in that any leeway in that that twenty five euro because for twenty five euro all we can really do is provide very basic remote control , and that seems to be against the philosophy of our company which is putting the fashion into electronics . so would would like to there's any chance of of increasing the of increasing the unit price . what would be wha but what would be one question , what would be the goal of putting an in remote control ? so you mean yo you mean we we should target something which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to in terms to had to have really an added value ? so regarding the automatic speech recognition , this is they have tele teletext . 'cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . what what information ?
it's not possible . but but , it would be good to there is any leverage in that any leeway in that that twenty five euro because for twenty five euro all we can really do is provide very basic remote control , and that seems to be against the philosophy of our company which is putting the fashion into electronics . so would would like to there's any chance of of increasing the of increasing the unit price . what would be wha but what would be one question , what would be the goal of putting an in remote control ? so you mean yo you mean we we should target something which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to in terms to had to have really an added value ? so regarding the automatic speech recognition , this is they have tele teletext . 'cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . what what information ? but mo most of the t_v_s nowadays show the show the the but most of the t_v_s have teletext nowadays . because they have teletext on it .
so you mean yo you mean we we should target something which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to in terms to had to have really an added value ? so regarding the automatic speech recognition , this is they have tele teletext . 'cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . what what information ? but mo most of the t_v_s nowadays show the show the the but most of the t_v_s have teletext nowadays . because they have teletext on it . you have teletext sin signal that you can that you can that you can get thr through the channel . they have most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid one of our requirements is to to move to teletext to to the use of internet . so to to to browse more easily the teletext . you can get lot more information on it .
they may not have pictures , but they do . there's dependi it also depends on the country . because for the same reason that we cannot informations on the t_v_ . we we couldn't grab information information which is not there . no but with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . so it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . so so that mean we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the t_v_ , or or it should be special t_v_ connected to . if we're gonna we would definitely need the internet connection because even with don't think you could even get teletext information from the t_v_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the t_v_ . we need to find that out . we need to close the meeting .
means twenty five euros is , . this is what we need to find out . can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? 'cause otherwise we need it's hard to guarantee that you're gonna ninety five percent is not good enough though . this is up to you to tell us . but i'm definitely not keen on to to no no no , i'm no i'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies . i'm not confident enough . i'm not that that we'll have product really that work . that work it's real . how to guarantee such performances is really hard .
so you're four ? which is trend watch . mr marketing experts . investigate the preference more investigate deeper the preference of the users . so the the current investigation the current the current trends ? wha what found can you . what found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . after they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current the current trend which was the functional look and feel . so now more more aspect , ma more cooler aspect rather than device with many functions and many buttons with instead of instead of ha of device which can do many things , device which is pleasant to to watch , to see . also in euro in in paris and and milan the in paris and in paris and milan the the current trend of of clothes , furniture and all this all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables .
what you mean clothe no , missed that one . spongy means it it's like sp but what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? didn't miss an didn't miss and saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . they're so they're not like dressed as carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , . no no , not not yet , not yet . so we're not gonna have remote control in the shape of of banana , just and so which fruit are you thinking of ? so te textu textures , . vegetable textures and all this kind . drawings of bananas . so this is in the next slide certainly .
didn't miss an didn't miss and saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . they're so they're not like dressed as carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , . no no , not not yet , not yet . so we're not gonna have remote control in the shape of of banana , just and so which fruit are you thinking of ? so te textu textures , . vegetable textures and all this kind . drawings of bananas . so this is in the next slide certainly . no no , it's not . ha haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some vegetable , some instead of vegetable , some natur natural object .
so te textu textures , . vegetable textures and all this kind . drawings of bananas . so this is in the next slide certainly . no no , it's not . ha haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some vegetable , some instead of vegetable , some natur natural object . but it it depends on the the shape the shape no , not not not too much focus , not too much focu not not too not too similar to fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . so you you can display banana on the . so you want the remote control to be the shape of fruit , or you want just some like fruit logo on the so something that looks half like fruit and half like an elephant . means buttons are in the shape of fruits , buttons are in the frape shape of fruits , apple , banana , something like that .
no no , it's not . ha haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some vegetable , some instead of vegetable , some natur natural object . but it it depends on the the shape the shape no , not not not too much focus , not too much focu not not too not too similar to fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . so you you can display banana on the . so you want the remote control to be the shape of fruit , or you want just some like fruit logo on the so something that looks half like fruit and half like an elephant . means buttons are in the shape of fruits , buttons are in the frape shape of fruits , apple , banana , something like that . apple for channel one . so we shouldn't be at re really attached to to the trend but , . african or as an elephant ? that we can discuss afterwards .
that we can discuss afterwards . but , i'm not , i'm not really if that would really appeal to everyone though , just to fashion gurus , like just like little bit little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but about how ergonomic , an orange is . ma we we should further specify what target are we focusing . in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices and also according to the marketing report ninety ninety five percent of young people was was was able to to buy cooler remote control . but is it is fruit ? is the new trend of the no we we should think about shape with it device with shape of some . , apple has the ipod so , imag 'cause they have an apple on their on their product , doesn't mean fruit is . but it has to be easy to to use though and to hold , you don't wanna pear or watermelon . don don't you think we can find the shape of fruit which is handy to use ? probably the only thing is banana that think of , cucumber .
probably the only thing is banana that think of , cucumber . so , but you also have to you have to also have , fit all the buttons and . it's , it the thing is you have normally with with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on cylindrical device it may be difficult to to build . don't it will be rolling lot . but li like your idea that we shouldn't have lot of buttons buttons so do you want an with twenty five euros ? and you you you will not have pla enough lot of place to put on banana also . you're the marketing expert you should tell us if it is too much or not . according to the to the report people are more interested in in fa fancy look and feel and in technological inno in innovation , so , will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the new inputs and also it's i'm not convinced about this because you need internet connection , you need more things , it's not just buying new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying more things . so so you you you suggest to go . so you're simply you're simply looking to remote control that looks like banana with few buttons with only few buttons .
you train it for certain , for certain phrase , you say the the example they said that they have up and running with their prototype is they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that that we're producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ? and it's just to , it's just to playback something ? so actually that was bad example , 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so . so this is not really to do to to do control . only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize set set target word an it's designed it's designed as fun thing , but you could use it as as way to implement completely pointless . this is just more like poi pois . so it it's it it it is easy fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of point of view . but you can but the can we use it for saying , channel fifty , channel twenty ? unless , you like having conversation with your remote control . that's the thing , if you can but you have to pro though it's fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to tr train it to to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that logic in it .
unless , you like having conversation with your remote control . that's the thing , if you can but you have to pro though it's fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to tr train it to to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that logic in it . so this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it . so , that would be some development work . so this is out of discussion . so if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control no this is banana-bando , . banana-man don't t's worth it though , it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as speech recognition engine , so , . then it could be . let's go ahead . so if we can just move on to the next slide , i've just done quick mock-up of some of the features of our potential funky-looking remote control , you see , was was unaware at this point of of the fruit focus , , so at the moment it's more of box focus .
double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if i'm . so it's symmetrical thing , whatever it is . so , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want . so there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . these are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with certain other materials we cannot have double curve . so there there was there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's wooden cases . although , , wood could be quite stylish option , if you take like , quality wood that's got grain and you put some , some varnish on . but but there is no elasticity which could be but the components inside . depends , , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken , it's the inside . but inside you could have you can still have some cushioning that's not visible to the to the user .
actually was thinking that the the shape of banana is not it's not really handy . look like it looks like you are all targeting that ? yes it is . the name in english this it's not fruit it's vegetable . is it an apple which has banana is more handier as compared to this , and to capsicum . it's like pumpkin or green . what does it taste like ? and you put in the salad . oui c'est ca pepper . is it what's it in french ?
, so capsicum or pepper . but they do . and it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of no , in i'm it's fun . it seems little bit bulky to me , like like with banana you can have but like banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel on top and just roll it back and forth like that , but with how you would hold capsicum and so is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which , but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ? it's not re it you you t's really fancy and fun ? you think that young people that are . more than banana ? but banana is not so handy , that's handier . it's kind it's it's more it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've lot of surface to to put the controls . let's move on .
it's not re it you you t's really fancy and fun ? you think that young people that are . more than banana ? but banana is not so handy , that's handier . it's kind it's it's more it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've lot of surface to to put the controls . let's move on . so time is running , let's move on . so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , just and scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . these are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that . we can go to the next slide .
the basis station . basis station , . so so we're going for stylish banana shape . so , you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna hold as ma you wanna kinda hold like gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point towards the floor . so , so if you have like , so so , so we need , , something that can fit banana shaped object . what about what about this shape ? more or less . we if it if it has really the model shape of bana you could the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of banana if you want to point really at the thing . there's less space on this to put with the buttons . but how many buttons do we need ?
just the switch , no not for the t_v_ for the t_v_ . remotes don't have power on off switch . so you on the side . no , that'll be controlled by the those buttons'll be there already , . what what about four millions ? means on the remote . because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as as buttons . they are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . if the traditional user is gonna buy banana remote in the first place , . that's that's another issue which didn't think of .
means on the remote . because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as as buttons . they are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . if the traditional user is gonna buy banana remote in the first place , . that's that's another issue which didn't think of . you need to keep it , how many of these did we wanna sell ? but our targets are very high , means fifty million euros is the profit which we want make . 't remember , what was , but how many units did we need to to sell ? twelve point five is the profit on one . point point four million ?
twelve point five is the profit on one . point point four million ? four point four million . point four million . that's lot of fruit . in the market . what about what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ? time is running , we have to close the meeting in few minutes . so , , the next step , you can come back to your seat . the next step is to go for to is to go to to building prototype , based on this , ?
four point four million . point four million . that's lot of fruit . in the market . what about what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ? time is running , we have to close the meeting in few minutes . so , , the next step , you can come back to your seat . the next step is to go for to is to go to to building prototype , based on this , ? so next meeting you have to prepare the followi things . you have to work on the look and feel design and you have to work on the user interface , you two you have to work together to model the first first prototype .
time is running , we have to close the meeting in few minutes . so , , the next step , you can come back to your seat . the next step is to go for to is to go to to building prototype , based on this , ? so next meeting you have to prepare the followi things . you have to work on the look and feel design and you have to work on the user interface , you two you have to work together to model the first first prototype . marketing expert have to go to product evaluation . it's too difficult . it's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really innovative and if it would cost lot , just few five words . it's not possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , so it's in the next prototype so let's skip it . for the future prototypes .
this is teletext button . so once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as to navigate . to navigate it through through teletext . but if you want to go to page seven hundred ? with the wheel it's easy . how man don't understand it . then you can you you have like little number selection thing , you press the the the teletext button to move between the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can and this is the the infrared port . can you repeat it ? so then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing . and you can tele , once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .
actually they do . that's that's that's that's form and function in the one in the one object . so it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having better coverage . it's like antennas . but that's that's just like that's an attractive base station . so , what else ? and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and the basis station is going to have the input from the power line for for charging the batteries . is it really weight ? is it light or . it is very light .
eight to ten eight to ten hours . long , so it's it's used only when you . no no no , it can it should be weeks . most no most of the time it's not being used . but people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so , . so when when you are making it on . no eight or eight or ten hours of working . if you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer . and we are having the speakers regular chip for control . pricing is was factor so that's why we have gone for regular chip only not the advanced chip .
how long the how long the bit the batteries long . eight to ten eight to ten hours . long , so it's it's used only when you . no no no , it can it should be weeks . most no most of the time it's not being used . but people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so , . so when when you are making it on . no eight or eight or ten hours of working . if you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer . and we are having the speakers regular chip for control .
it seems to be falling over . like like it . the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons . looks bit looks bit puzzled how to say that . you want to have more functional buttons ? you the the the buttons change their function depending if it's teletext or not and the volume button will will become and what about people who want to use digits ? you are not convinced . not not many , we we want to keep it simple . so that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons . it's up to you , means .
you are not convinced . not not many , we we want to keep it simple . so that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons . it's up to you , means . now that means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits . fact both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext . or can move between positions in the in the number . butto real buttons ? so there was there was constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape . so we are targeting segment which is which is just very trendy thing , they they don't care about the buttons any more .
so there was there was constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape . so we are targeting segment which is which is just very trendy thing , they they don't care about the buttons any more . and anyway evalua . because have you thought about configuration and all this ? it's all automatic . it's all automatic . very good you . we are living in wonderful world . so so we have to go through now evaluations . so your slides are ready ?
it's all automatic . it's all automatic . very good you . we are living in wonderful world . so so we have to go through now evaluations . so your slides are ready ? so this is one , which one is this one ? const constructed list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . and each criteria is will be evaluated it's logical criteria so we must users must say if it's true or is or if it's false in in scale ranging from zero to seven . why this strange factor of seven ?
usually have seen that scales are from one to ten . it's from , it's from one to seven . it's from from one to seven . because it should be an even it should be an even scale , and five is too short and nine is too long . num number so to have in order to have enough granularity it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation . fine , got the idea . the variance is mi it's is minimal . i'm answering your question . and that's the criteria found more useful . sh could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ?
have to say four . actually what are the the real specification of of universal remote contro it's not an univer but it's for all t_v_s ? t's not universal remote . remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on t_v_s . all t_v_s but only t_ only t_v_s . so it's universal but for t_v_s . so four point two ? there are some outliers so which i'll say five . there i'll give it seven . it means features , like new features actually .
t's not universal remote . remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on t_v_s . all t_v_s but only t_ only t_v_s . so it's universal but for t_v_s . so four point two ? there are some outliers so which i'll say five . there i'll give it seven . it means features , like new features actually . for t_v_ the most important feature which felt was the locator which is feature . and then the scroll buttons are again features .
there are some outliers so which i'll say five . there i'll give it seven . it means features , like new features actually . for t_v_ the most important feature which felt was the locator which is feature . and then the scroll buttons are again features . we don't have for it but that we decided we don't want to have . would say five . plus six , say said seven . so it's six . you said seven ?
it's more targeting u_k_ or so this is selling costs , not production costs . wha the initial specifications were for the whole all europe or this is the the initial specifications . would say six . it's quite cheap actually . i'd say two . don't want banana on my living room table , banana remote . aw , should be in your it's kitsch . no but it's really handy actually if you see . it is handy , it's handy , but it it's terrible . it's it's so handy .
and you have saved it ? so upload the it's two different situations . you'll have to reload . so , it depends if if had if had to spend twenty five euro , if that was like my limit , would buy it . if you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for for new one . that's two different question . because the other twenty five euro remote controls are probably gonna look worse than banana . they're not going to be as and they they might not be as easy as this . and it this is gonna handy to use . go slightly up .
wh wh you said five ? no said five . no no you say five , he is the outlier . just just do sum . if it's no because there are more , we shouldn't sum like that . it's not very promising but we're not young trendsetters . we should we should have look globally glob . because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually . otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell . is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up ?
no didn't anything . just leave it at that then . so we can we should stick to general feeling . we can had have out of these numbers , which which is that should go for it . do you want me to sum it's not actually what's the differen too expensive . problem with connectors ? it it you just lose information if you sum it , so . it's it's funny . so let's move let's move on . now now we have to to estimate the cost .
no , it's too no . it's too expensive . we're already at eleven . we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in . so put rubber one . so special colour , yellow . for the interface we have we have three . we don't have any push buttons . no , we have two push buttons . no that is scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that .
there's no chip there . it just emits the signal . and the receiver accepts it and that's it . just se sends the signal , that's it . it's recharger thing and actually did think about it myself but because you could potentially you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for instead of turbo button but the turbo button does add that extra class . we didn't think thought about integrated scroll wheel push buttons . so if we're if we're over budget then we could we could rethink that . so no , so for we have no button supplements , ? fact could we could not we consider this button as button supplement because no , these are these are for colours , co and special forms , special colours and special materials . no we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons .
we'll invest in and d_ . the next fruit . so 're under the the the cost . so we can go to through to project evaluation . so now we have product which nobody would would buy . would , would buy . no we have product which none of us would buy . because the evaluation project would buy , . which is different . which is different .
the cost of the thing can be made more than might be . because it's just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to . there are ways we could simplify the just the the the circuit board that we're using inside , i'm not really how complicated our our needs are . all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers , do we really need an integrated circuit to to process that . so more general remote control instead of just focusing on on t_v_ . the complexity shouldn't be much higher . for you said if it good for d_v_d_ then would bye . and also fo for mood lighting and and , that would be rather . that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to to control things other than the t_v_ and not just electronic equipment but the whole environment of the room . so what else ?
they should be remote . it it works like this . your lapel microphone's fallen off . are you left-handed ? like horses because they are strong and beautiful , so if want to write it here , . it's better if you leave it . we should just continue . don't worry about it . you won't draw them , or ? you can draw it , if you want .
from experience , i've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . and and normally you only every use , , on t_v_ remote you only ever use , mostly , , four or six buttons . so it's frustrated me in the past , that . have also some points . first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like back light . and it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . so something like this . and the second thing , second point from me would be that in normal remote control there is there are two buttons for volume control . but prefer like potential-meter like . some slider or not just two discrete buttons for volume , but something which , but reach in one second mute it down , or or make high volume .
just simple experience . prefer remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in specific direction and then try it hard to tune . without obstacles and . have meeting in five minutes , so we should hurry . so we will close this meeting . so we will have next meeting in thirty minutes . the so will ask you to do some work . the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and read about . which which is hamed , ? he's the industrial designer ?
without obstacles and . have meeting in five minutes , so we should hurry . so we will close this meeting . so we will have next meeting in thirty minutes . the so will ask you to do some work . the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and read about . which which is hamed , ? he's the industrial designer ? no , you're the industrial designer . am the technical designer , which one , .
no , you're the industrial designer . am the technical designer , which one , . that's the first . and the second one is the user interface designer . and then last one's marketing , which is me . so i'm the first one . so , for the user interface designer , which is hamed , , you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control . and for the marketing manager , , , which is bob , you are going to try to to find the user requirements for the remote control . you will receive by email the specific instructions and by your personal coach . so see you in thirty minutes .
you have to come here . have to get up . it should stay . should stay in the square here . so i'm gonna present some findings of study we conducted into what users want in this remote control . you can put it here . that's , it's jus . so first of all we what we did is we conducted an experiment with hundred test subjects . we put them in in our usability laboratory and got them to , , play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete questionnaire to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . so the major things we found out was that users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market .
that's the wrong one , . it's still bob morris . because you cancelled it . you should have put yes . click on yes . so here is my presentation about technical function design . will talk about different components and of system and how they react together . , first what is remote control ? simply it's device , as , for , for sending some commands by some waves to another device to to tell different commands with this device . and the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device .
don't , because we can make we ca we can make this wave in specific frequency . so they can be in range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home . so can we use any any frequency ? it should be . we have the to use any frequency ? no but as know , there is range for for this for for for this , for designing this circuit . we can we can we can tune our transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . and what happen with radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , ? and so do they have the same frequency , or ? for this i'm not the solution , but one solution can be something like putting password inside the wave , so the only your t_v_ can understand it , identification code inside the the password may simply or identification code may simply solve this problem .
no but as know , there is range for for this for for for this , for designing this circuit . we can we can we can tune our transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . and what happen with radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , ? and so do they have the same frequency , or ? for this i'm not the solution , but one solution can be something like putting password inside the wave , so the only your t_v_ can understand it , identification code inside the the password may simply or identification code may simply solve this problem . know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . it's handshaking , , when starting to when you start to communicate with the your t_v_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . so so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the t_v_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . can be problem sometimes , but most of the time it works . specific remote control has specific .
and so do they have the same frequency , or ? for this i'm not the solution , but one solution can be something like putting password inside the wave , so the only your t_v_ can understand it , identification code inside the the password may simply or identification code may simply solve this problem . know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . it's handshaking , , when starting to when you start to communicate with the your t_v_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . so so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the t_v_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . can be problem sometimes , but most of the time it works . specific remote control has specific . but we we don't have to think about this because as function designer that we will use the already made circuits which we probably bu buy . it's worth to buy . and they have these problems solved so .
it should work , so you can . so will speak about working design . that's the first slide . what have to do ? look at what the other company so presently am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and like that because didn't work with these circuits so far so have to look what what is available on the market for for the communication for the i_r_ circuits and so on , so i'm currently looking what is available on the web . and wanted to ask you afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , would be glad if you can tell me about them . findings , that's the point that i'm working on currently but so far was looking what what are the blue circuit , radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , but the prices read are high . so , know that the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can you can make the t_v_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , but , when you are not close to the t_v_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so am am voting for to stick to the infra-red control instead of r_w_ but we will discuss it later . components to use , i'm not exactly what will use for the design of the circuit . it depends on whether we will use the and mainly the speech recognition , because the speech rec ?
no no no no no . this we this we buy , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves . so we just buy circuit board and . but i'm not about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . this prefer that we should make ourselves . but it depends whether we take decision to use it . it's fairly expensive to use these circuits . so , speech recognition , it's because it's common nowadays to use , so agree on using any , less buttons good for me as as designer of the circuit . but the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , . so what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ?
or it would be feasible ? was not thinking too much about the price . but if we use the even the radio frequency communication with the t_v_ set and the backlight and related things like the photo diodes and , it should be . if we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . it depends of you if if the m_e_ or u_i_d_ , i'm about the names , don't really know , want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and like that , so . we will discuss it afterwards . this is nothing . this is just my notes on what to use . and my personal preference is yes , would like also preferably to use r_w_ circuit , but from the point of view of the design and price , would stick to i_r_s . that's my opinion .
three to three to five . not ten times , but it depends what what we . that's still lot . it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money , because all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . so it's not worth spending the extra money . on the other side , we want to have something new . they are used to use it when they can see the t_v_ so , . where we want to to have something new and so we we should still thinking about it . but , based on my usability studies feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . so we're better off spending money in the usability phase .
that's still lot . it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money , because all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . so it's not worth spending the extra money . on the other side , we want to have something new . they are used to use it when they can see the t_v_ so , . where we want to to have something new and so we we should still thinking about it . but , based on my usability studies feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . so we're better off spending money in the usability phase . you the user interface , and management man , , that's it for me . so have to inform you receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control .
you should probably speak . , the obvious one is changing channels . we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . so , turning channel , . just one note to the chan channel changing . do we will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? those nine plus one or two ? it would be . because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . on the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's we could think of something more betweens , like .
those nine plus one or two ? it would be . because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . on the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's we could think of something more betweens , like . so so we keep all these all these buttons . at least nine , ten button . like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus . something like that . or using the names and the keyboard . we could have key buttons , like discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and and inside this this thing you can move , switch .
not on the control , on the screen , on the t_v_ screen . not on the control , but on the screen . this would avoid , then . don't , don't but don't think we're we're the ones . this remote control we're developing is generic control for all t_v_s , . if it's possible to to watch something on t_v_ . it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the t_v_ to to to print these things . wi it will be still more expensive , but for the and this is no problem in the price . so , what are we doing with the settings ? because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so .
because generally yes . it's it's setting , . it should fit in those settings functions . because it's not very current useful function . when they say power button they mean to turn the t_v_ on and off . no , it's after after five minutes timer , no ? you don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . but if you're watching t_v_ for two hours , you don't want your t_v_ to turn off after five five minute based on our usability studies again , pe people said that the power button was very relevant button . so we should keep this button . , it was nine out of ten re relevance .
you don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . but if you're watching t_v_ for two hours , you don't want your t_v_ to turn off after five five minute based on our usability studies again , pe people said that the power button was very relevant button . so we should keep this button . , it was nine out of ten re relevance . so we we could what we could probably do is to keep also to keep keep the and all the buttons and , we could make it like opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the t_v_ and if you close it , it will turn off the t_v_ . if if you like this , because , t's question for you . we need to concentrate on the , , the major usage of the of the control , which is you sit down , you turn on your t_v_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the t_v_ off . and all the other functionality is not used very often . they can they can be hide somewhere by cover like this . like covering cu .
like the but since we have the , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . like mobile phone covering . , just the decision of the power button . should we make it button , or some some something which would be power button . button is better . it should be bu its own button on the front . if it if it's button or . button , so . one big button . old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers .
we have still one or two minutes to talk , . what what was the question ? clock or yes . , some func some features on the control to display time , or to display probably not . usually it's already on t_v_ like that . but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , no ? because if if the t_v_ turns on itself , it , if the time the timer should be there . if we if we add the time , we have to have bigger display like that , and is it very useful ? are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? this is the question .
clock or yes . , some func some features on the control to display time , or to display probably not . usually it's already on t_v_ like that . but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , no ? because if if the t_v_ turns on itself , it , if the time the timer should be there . if we if we add the time , we have to have bigger display like that , and is it very useful ? are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? this is the question . is it useful ? it's questi , it's trade-off .
it's questi , it's trade-off . in my opinion we should have only useful thing and because they want the simpler it's is better . did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the t_v_ , and based on your but it can be on the display in in corner all the time on the remote . very , , very occasionally . but do use the do use the display of the time quite often , but . that's , that's true . so no time button . no time on . and do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ? thin it will not take lots of place , we just need microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this and it's not very difficult to put software inside the the electronic device and put microphone .
put electronic card on spongy thing , imagine it could be problem . all these things in in in this box are to put in in any shape , . but we have to take care of the t_f_t_ . it good feature , since it takes if it's around the t_f_t_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , . it can have two shells , hard shell inside and spongy shell outside . so so ca can ask question . put electronic in box and spongy thing around . it's related to the u_i_ . that's all from me . this seven inch t_f_t_ screen , how big is it in reality ?
put electronic in box and spongy thing around . it's related to the u_i_ . that's all from me . this seven inch t_f_t_ screen , how big is it in reality ? seven to seven inches . so like that . that's quite big . have we decided that we're gonna use this t_f_t_ screen ? but to be honest , was , honestly speaking was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , but it's seven inches . no , don't t's seven by seven , it's seven the diagonal is seven .
seven to seven inches . so like that . that's quite big . have we decided that we're gonna use this t_f_t_ screen ? but to be honest , was , honestly speaking was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , but it's seven inches . no , don't t's seven by seven , it's seven the diagonal is seven . usually when they say seven inch it's the diagonal . but even even that is like this big . dun dun one each . but , , .
this is like this is almost nothing . seven to seven to at least some three millimetres . even from my perspective seven seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still is it can you hold that , or ? but we wanted the big buttons and like that , . because if it's too small we can we can lose it , at home , . what user wants . he wants small remote control , or ? small control that they can hold in hand . with big buttons . that it it should fit in the hand .
he wants small remote control , or ? small control that they can hold in hand . with big buttons . that it it should fit in the hand . sm so you can finish your presentation , and afterwards we will discuss about all this . but is something that's seven centimetres square easy to hold ? if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and follow follow , that's that's no task for me , but seven to seven at least , but , . so we have lot we have to take decision today , so we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . first energy it's key problem because it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , , like that . because can we have and speech recognition with battery , and it's also related to the size of the of the devi of the device ?
not just point to the energy things . if we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's for l_ speech recognition and , so no problem in energy , . but we have to use the solar cell . like but using how many batteries , ? are are what what is the size of the battery . was thinking just common a_a_ cells . so like three to five centimetres , exactly , but . so if we use solar cells , where is the sun if someone's watching t_v_ inside ? doesn't need to be sun . it it's just the daylight , .
doesn't need to be sun . it it's just the daylight , . the television lights . suppose that suppose that that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . at least when there is t_v_ you can get light from the t_v_ . from the t_ don't t's enough , . it's it's compromise , no ? at least it's new and technology new technology . that's why wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . it's it's quite innovative , yes .
for the for the , if we choose to have small device , we cannot use this such screen . the the screen is , but the board , that's the problem . what what would you as shape ? or what what would be the shape ? their being large or small is not important . the only important thing is to be able to take it in inside hand easily . so let's say an average size , , and it should not be very heavy also . and prefer to is it shouldn't have uniform shape , so in the middle it should be little bit thinner , . so we it's like like some joysticks . you can take some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape .
or what what would be the shape ? their being large or small is not important . the only important thing is to be able to take it in inside hand easily . so let's say an average size , , and it should not be very heavy also . and prefer to is it shouldn't have uniform shape , so in the middle it should be little bit thinner , . so we it's like like some joysticks . you can take some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . so the general shape should be like this . seven centimetre by seven centimetre is little bit large . so seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's it's that's my opinion .
five to ten . five five centimetres by ten centimetres . it's feasib one how could we do it ? we could put the board next to , , under the and make the be unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . like holding something , and the to be just on top of it , somehow . but let's stick to the spongy thing , like one unit . i've the easiest thing would be to to have smaller , if it's possible . fi five to ten it would be feasible . so five to ten , it's it's feasible . so we are agree with small .
but if you want to look at the screen , no . ll , it can be whatever you want . this is not good . or it can be like shape , quite , with curves . but if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . but if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . it's like more more expensive to have shape like that . but don't care . if we fit this requirement . 'd like shaped screen .
like like peeling of the banana you it would be , . peeling of the banana . peeling of the banana , , should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden . and you mean the first layer would be spongy . first layer spo , it's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , . so is it is it possible to do that ? it would be idea , but is it possible technically ? like doing spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . if we if we have spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , , to manipulate that to hav be cover that you can pull off and for . some something like plastic cover covering some interface , u_s_b_ interface as in the in digital camera .
let's talk about money . just tr try to who is user interface designer . according to the drawings . twenty five euro for remote control . that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control . we aim to do this profit . 'tis big number . on the international market . we're to sell two million then . for production cost of twelve fifty euros maximum .
yes , we have plenty at home . my daughter likes remote controls . that so that could be application . mainly , and to break . remote controls children proof . so she likes buttons which make click , so it has to click . so they have to be waterproof ? it has to be wha baby proof but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's high enough so that when she throw it away it's so it has to be very robust . 'cause they eat she ate it . we have some child lock , .
too expensive , . and not too expensive , t's not my problem , but . and too expensive . but no screens on remote controls . it could be only screen which would change depending on the use or even the user . so ma prefer to have the off button at the top , so would have my own design of the remote control because it's just full touch screen remote control , if you if you like . it it's like it's like two types no ? if it makes sense , but , , . people are handed or left handed so because am left handed use like this , say if you're handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on . so adaptable something .
if it makes sense , but , , . people are handed or left handed so because am left handed use like this , say if you're handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on . so adaptable something . if if it's possible , . alright , good , so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? even we can keep two switches and then we can only make one working . we can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if i'm left-hander use this switch to follow the main operations . if it's less than three then we can make it like like three mental states , what , we can just make it controlled by brain , ? three buttons you mean ? if it's more , if there is software inside that ask you three .
even we can keep two switches and then we can only make one working . we can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if i'm left-hander use this switch to follow the main operations . if it's less than three then we can make it like like three mental states , what , we can just make it controlled by brain , ? three buttons you mean ? if it's more , if there is software inside that ask you three . if it if we want universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three three button , three possibilities , ye . more than three actions that you may want to do at given time . but for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . but when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . and that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five .
three buttons you mean ? if it's more , if there is software inside that ask you three . if it if we want universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three three button , three possibilities , ye . more than three actions that you may want to do at given time . but for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . but when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . and that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . you do this ? usually just change channels . because i'm only using three or four channels but and then back to the one was before , so there's whichever it was .
like something to to like phones . some of the phones have some of this functionality . phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your your remote control . you can you are . but why not ? and because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they how to they to use properly their remote controls . and they are bad for r_s_i_ but don't remember what is r_s_i_ . so they are bad . tha that's look . nobody has any idea about that ?
'll check with my , , it's technical thing which our . it's electromagnetic waves effect . no , don't . because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , and those waves have high . so , it seems that it's lot of people for concept that we but we have to take this into account . but twenty six percent , do twenty five . every fourth , . it's people really . every four some of us knows . so anyway that's for what the biggest frustration of the user and what else do have ?
it's techni function of . no , user requiremen makes sense . have to do working design so . that's but this but number three , yes . so , my name is mark dwight , and am responsible for user interface design . however , project manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . as i'm more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more user interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . so next slide . and general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about occam razor . we should never complicate things too much .
let's say am on channel eight now . these days we have hundreds of channels , that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . would propose another solution . or is it ? you use just four or five channels , ? so set up your t_v_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to twenty fives channel . in in one remote control that i've seen , instead of doing that you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and sixty four are those that want to by cycled with my next button . it's it's the same solution , . but even we can have some display , like you can de you can just button the number and then it go because . go to channel twenty five .
could could have look at that . i'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . for your attention . so now the technical aspects of this new device . you prefer it . as , am mister ramaro . am an expert in industrial design of all electronic devices and previously devised many like digital calculators and electronic calculators . so now i'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . as the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like t_v_ or v_c_r_ or d_v_d_ player etcetera . so we will have portable device which will send message to the the main device like t_v_ .
not very much , like . so , , we're just on time . can you just . so , we're now going to have the lunch break . then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and we will meet again for the next meeting , and in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the on the components so you will focus on the component concept the u_i_d_ mark will be focused on the user interface concept and our market expert sammy benjo on the trend watching . mark will it's in current price , . so like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . and we have we have to we say , only for t_v_ , not teletext ? automatic on off control it's not possible . in the next step if we make it work .
speakers in the remote cont . like , you want to find it , you shout control , and it answers is i'm here ? that's or you want to phone him . or just beeps ? it just beeps . that would be enough . something very cheap . but that's ex that's expensive . since now all ? especially the power , it really consumes because it should be all the time on and .
it just beeps . that would be enough . something very cheap . but that's ex that's expensive . since now all ? especially the power , it really consumes because it should be all the time on and . heard of devices where you just whistle them and and they because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . and and it's answered . no , no , 't . you can't whistle .
and and it's answered . no , no , 't . you can't whistle . clap clap clap it's good it's universal . you can clap . clap is good . tak just suggestion . what about people without hand ? with only one hand ? these are not our target people .
with only one hand ? these are not our target people . but it's good feature we need to think about more how to incorporate it . just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping . that's that already exists . got it at my home , like . you do have . so let's to think so that . think about it . that could be in the component concept .
don't be sarcastic . so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what energy we use what chip on print and one ki case . and also on user interface concept what interface we use and if there is some supplements . and at the end sammy will give trend watching on what he's he's been doing . it's so , let's go . first with rama . so we're to mainly design mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . for energy there are two or three possibilities .
like you can have two curves . it's in manufacturing it's problematic . so , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need simple chip and it's really lesser re really less expensive compared to which are which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce cost . want to know why it just but for the point before why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . and also like in if you put it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and . you titanium it's more yes so . we can use something like the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to . like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and . but full assembly we'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes . and this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of l_c_d_s and so we want to mo we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , so so it's like we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five euros or so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter , that can we we can consider , because like it won't take much money , because , .
so the batteries are going to be very light . we're to go for li and now we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for really light batteries and with good price . so this device on that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just the finding it , instead of clapping why not just be ask . that's then the the one thing we want to like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it at least five , six people want to use it so so how to how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do speaker independent or speaker dependent . if we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really more technology and so , if if everybody in the house to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology . for the location . so let's now go to the you don't have more question ? no , it's . no more questions . puts less of constraint on what we can do but it's always like that .
no , it's . no more questions . puts less of constraint on what we can do but it's always like that . we have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible . we have some limitations . but still l_s_d_'s already quite , l_c_ i'm an artist , . l_s_d_ is something else , and it's quite as . so , go on artist . so , that's not hope that's not too much . now let's talk about interface .
so that's our concept . it's called the millennium remote control . let's change millenniums . so you can use in the end and . doesn't make sense . this is very ugly . you like it . no , too much concept . just press the button , . we will not use this .
or did the but not the case . would make backlight of the screen with different colours . not the case . the case would only be in that aluminium titanium , like , they like something which is , , so that would be the option . because from your survey people like colours , no ? so let's remember there's nokia phone which changeable panels . do you like it ? don't have nokia phone , but don't use that but again , might , bu but . but it's but it would be expensive , no ? that's why you don't have it .
and you'll be different . you always have your remote . in the train , hello no . anyone has their remote controls here ? you don't have your remo wh you like take the ipod . want to change my neighbour . it's remote control . it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere . it has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's colour that we don't usually see in remote control . could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?
you don't have your remo wh you like take the ipod . want to change my neighbour . it's remote control . it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere . it has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's colour that we don't usually see in remote control . could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ? that they can use it in darkness , like . glow in the dark , so . hand light , . like the infrared like we can put some radium chips so that like at least .
that they can use it in darkness , like . glow in the dark , so . hand light , . like the infrared like we can put some radium chips so that like at least . let's go on with the presentation . and the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? and that's question to you and to to . so heard that it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done so that's the smartness of the thing . currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . so just just just just think about it .
or it's this you you so did you where ? we have people listening to the trends everywhere in the world , , as our company is quite big and so i'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask their friends that are also . it's not from . it's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control . no , it's not it's not this this is very general , . but it seems that trends travel across things . the what we . but some materials they're to be they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or . we have to we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside , so . sponge , at least that's that .
we have to . so , do you think . so we have to for so are we confident enough on creating trends ? no , we don't have to , but seems it's the trend . again , as said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . so there's no , that's you can try to convince us . we can make it smell like fruit . that's good idea . that's so what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? that's good idea , it's again in this what said first it has to be fancy so if nobody else pro provides currently remote control with that and if we can provide it it's good sell for us because we have it and others don't .
no , we don't have to , but seems it's the trend . again , as said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . so there's no , that's you can try to convince us . we can make it smell like fruit . that's good idea . that's so what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? that's good idea , it's again in this what said first it has to be fancy so if nobody else pro provides currently remote control with that and if we can provide it it's good sell for us because we have it and others don't . so titanium smell like fruit . or they really like they more want these fancy features like feature . whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important .
we have also some slides . yes , and place some slides . so in which . so this is our remote control . it's working prototype . you can use it now by switching all these buttons . so first , present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications . that's , so that's that . we analysed all the fruits and contacted nasa , and made some real good . if you can see this , and the stars are showing that .
these are strawberries . material , we want to stick to titanium . we will send , we want to , or so , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like shown in these phones . fruit smelling spongy titanium . didn't exist , but that's . you can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . and you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . you mean we can change the colour of . that's for the or for the titanium ? with titanium it's it is silver .
with titanium it's it is silver . tit titanium is , . we are still working on titanium . so , we'll start with . you can ask bob . you're theme today . even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or and you can have many colours on weekends . black for sunday . and , wh what are the strawberries for ? these are like sensors .
these are like sensors . what do you think ? that's location sensors . so , after this meeting we'll propose party for our success for so , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , let us know . and we can just some strawberry first . so , any specific questions for . we'll see in the financial part if all gets into who is the five fifty millions we first make party in ? it makes sense . let's make party first . then we can discuss we can , then we can have how much for how money is left .
it makes sense . let's make party first . then we can discuss we can , then we can have how much for how money is left . so , this is what design . so let's , , let's see if it's meet the evaluation criterium . it's my turn . let's see if this , if you meet the evaluation criterion . so , evaluation . you made very prototype , and , , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that . so , next slide , .
so let's , , let's see if it's meet the evaluation criterium . it's my turn . let's see if this , if you meet the evaluation criterion . so , evaluation . you made very prototype , and , , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that . so , next slide , . as , before going and creating and producing these strawberry remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have chance to sell it . so we need to evaluate it , try to do it in constative way , and as much as we can . to so what propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . one meaning that , ye yes it fulfils the the criterion , whatever it is .
these buttons are it not clear . , lets me try . but you have at least next produce . what is next , ? this is volume control and channel changes . it depends on the . these are the main you . and you can do di two sites ? and you can do on using these going to scrolling all the option . so but , , because the is not touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly .
this is volume control and channel changes . it depends on the . these are the main you . and you can do di two sites ? and you can do on using these going to scrolling all the option . so but , , because the is not touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly . so if you don't want , . you can , by using the you push here the the . you go you so , the basic mode . so that's simple .
it's size al almost , because it is the weight will be bit lighter . and and it's going to be lighter , because this seems to be very heavy , for my daughter , . we will we use titanium . without titanium alloy , it's going to be light . not if she can use it . but sides , the sides should be . so , should be . up to three for that , because i'm haven't seen the weight so must not colour and shape . so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the . but , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case .
, just look at it . it's full adaptable . that's yea , it's fudge titanium . you can fit it into your palm , . so you can fit into your palm , . that what else can we need ? you do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as ? it's fudge , , . it's two point one seven . fruit titanium , .
it's fudge , , . it's two point one seven . fruit titanium , . if if this is if you are ready to do that , then it deserves one . let's go for one . now we have to do the average . three , three , six , eight , eleven . who is good in math ? two point one seven . two point one seven out of seven .
let's go for one . now we have to do the average . three , three , six , eight , eleven . who is good in math ? two point one seven . two point one seven out of seven . we have good good thing . that's all had to say about the evaluation . so it seems to be good , . so it's good evaluation .
two point one seven . two point one seven out of seven . we have good good thing . that's all had to say about the evaluation . so it seems to be good , . so it's good evaluation . two one one seven , we have . so financi energy . so now , it has to fulfil the financial criterium ? so , have an here .
we use bat one battery . we just need one , . no , ne never install . two batteries or one ? no , number is one . we need only one battery . but the price is two . no , no . but no , no . no , you just number .
no , number is one . we need only one battery . but the price is two . no , no . but no , no . no , you just number . number , number . no , no way . you never use excel ? no , never .
no , never . how what what's the limit ? it's it's that , 'cause it's not my field . it's twelve bucks . twelve and half , . so we we have sample chip . check that number also . so it's simple chip ? like simple chip , . simple chip , .
it's it's that , 'cause it's not my field . it's twelve bucks . twelve and half , . so we we have sample chip . check that number also . so it's simple chip ? like simple chip , . simple chip , . four buttons at least . and then we have the sample speaker sensor for speech recognition .
like simple chip , . simple chip , . four buttons at least . and then we have the sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . and for the one also . one or two ? one to one . so the case , which one is it in the end ? we will go for single curve , no ? let's do single curve .
we will go for single curve , no ? let's do single curve . it's it's flat . it's flat , and curved . you can curve somebody . but it is flat , you look . it's curvable , but it's not curved . there is supplement for that , no ? it's only curve ? see , that the the price is this one .
let's do single curve . it's it's flat . it's flat , and curved . you can curve somebody . but it is flat , you look . it's curvable , but it's not curved . there is supplement for that , no ? it's only curve ? see , that the the price is this one . this , you we tried , we tried .
see , that the the price is this one . this , you we tried , we tried . don't chip on me . so , what is it ? but she wanted the fudge titanium . no , only one , no ? it's five , but you don't say . let's stick to titan . again , i'm see it . special colour , or it's only on the , but there is no colour here .
scro , two . three or two ? is there the scroll-wheel , . it's going to be expensive . one scroll wheel . that's that's not we choose this one , and not this one . , no it's , is it scroll wheel and pe push button , this centre one ? or only scroll-wheel . or only only scroll wheel , . only scroll wheel .
or only scroll-wheel . or only only scroll wheel , . only scroll wheel . so it's already . you are trying to make make up make us up . you try to no , no , no . because how do you do to select ? no , but you select with the two the other two buttons , no ? you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you stay longer . then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes .
you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you stay longer . then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes . and it will activate , plus , , it's price is really special colours , . it should stay . buttons and strawberries . no , buttons just normal . you you have all of these , no ? she's very hard on this . not this one but , so not special colours an interest in ? we have titan .
we have titan . that's for buttons . but buttons are standard . buttons are the standard buttons . it's only buttons , these . so we are at seventeen dot eight . no , the colour is in the . and buttons are not colourised ? they are boo-hoo . , because you can just go for good colours .
it's already too expensive . until we get twelve fifty . so think of what we can cut here . if look at what is the most expensive things , it's the and the speaker . we have to choose one or the other . as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , , producing electricity from mechanical energy . so , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy to make electricity . but you don't need battery ? that you don't need battery . so , it's something like hand dynamo robot .
the jog wheel can be like hand is . but why not . that's already that . it's it's beginning . let's do that . let's do that . so one here and here . and propose to so , about chips . advanced chip on print , ? so , put minus one there , .
so , was there result ? no , no . it's not it's not changing , no ? let's have look . it you don't so now on , we can increase our still you have two more . , , if click somewhere , you'll see features . yes , it does . put minus two , so it looks more reasonable . anyway no , minus two . nobody will know .
let's have look . it you don't so now on , we can increase our still you have two more . , , if click somewhere , you'll see features . yes , it does . put minus two , so it looks more reasonable . anyway no , minus two . nobody will know . it's not recorded , is it ? we're on time . we can put hand dynamo and battery if you want .
it's maximum and don't have to , . maximum is maximum . so , remove one of them . we're on target . so target reached . i'm just curious to see this my address chip on print . would say it's the russian trick , but anyway no , they may have some their origins , strange origins no , no , no . but is english . and we can discuss all these things in our party . am not who was programming this calculator , .
we've listened to everybody . everybody could say what they thought . is there enough room for creativity ? when we see the results , there is no doubt there lack of leadership ? team-work , very strong , would say . our team-work is really strong . team-work , no problem . whiteboard , digital pens . we still , . what was the , what was good ?
when we see the results , there is no doubt there lack of leadership ? team-work , very strong , would say . our team-work is really strong . team-work , no problem . whiteboard , digital pens . we still , . what was the , what was good ? white-board is useful . what was bad ? digital pens , useful .
white-board is useful . what was bad ? digital pens , useful . new ideas found ? so , you say , is there sheep ? so luck , but good . which imply good team performance . but , but then mus that's true . good leader , , good leader is somewhere in the shade and . and there's one very important point .
digital pens , useful . new ideas found ? so , you say , is there sheep ? so luck , but good . which imply good team performance . but , but then mus that's true . good leader , , good leader is somewhere in the shade and . and there's one very important point . we're on time . meetings finish when they have to or even before .
yes , it is . , it's we got two good score . so , we see , we can even forecast . they propose us like celebration , everything , we could forecast it , ? to the whole our company ? i'm the one , proposing the celebration . i'm the program manager . it was you . so , let's celebrate . the meeting the meeting is over at least .
to the whole our company ? i'm the one , proposing the celebration . i'm the program manager . it was you . so , let's celebrate . the meeting the meeting is over at least . so where we will go now ? ye will go to italian restaurant , or , . so , we have to go out . we can decide .
it's for your to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . so each of us has role to do . assign your roles . for each for each one . in each we already have our role . for each person , . we can so there are three kinds of designs , that's all . so there are so we have three . we have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design . so , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ?
our responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . no , i'm doing the interface . i'm doing the interface . you are doing . are you using the you are doing the in . i'm i'm , we have so industrial design . it was little confusion about my but it's alright . i'll for industrial design . and and you norman ? and and doing the marketing .
you mean the external or of . you have to make it work . that's the that's the big thing . it should be easy to work with . we can think about an interface with , . we you can have speech recognition interface . you just tell the television want which channel . or or you can say , want to list all the programme tonight . you won't if we include lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . instead of remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want .
the main function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . in the hand . if we are going to add speech interface , i'm not with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put speech recog if you want to put speech recognition system interface for that the t_v_ itself could have it . yes , possible . and could talk to the t_v_ television itself . except if if you are far from the t_v_ . need not have an we have some , different technology but , . this is it's . but the main idea wanted to wanted to say is that there should be function , instead of choosing the ch t_v_ channel , there's option you can choose , either t_v_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . on the content .
if if you you you can if you want you can use the . go on , draw something . i'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel . where is it ? or before the before the the design that says . where where is it ? just plug it . be before before writing you can sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the . so so the most functional des the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . we agree on that , ?
and the second one is for the software . is the is the software par alri . to run to make it run . so you can control if you want , ? alright and that's it for the working design . so if you have any questions ? and how about the battery power ? you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? no no no no , we have to to have embedded batteries in in the into the . into the more compact and , .
no no no no , we have to to have embedded batteries in in the into the . into the more compact and , . and don't will need very much power to make it run , so . you can put it on the charger when you when you don't need to use it . it's good idea . having charger rather than putting the battery cells always . people don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . we just make small charger and put it bu our remote , we do not want to make it p_d_a_ . because you are using because you are using bluetooth , if some people have p_d_a_ they can use their p_d_a_ to control the t_v_ if they want to , ? that's good idea .
that's good idea . ma we can change the . also , but but the the goal is to sell our remote control . so charger for is the . so is mine . participant one , no ? we have so let's move to to user interface design . so you can open three . participant during the weekend . so so i'm working on the technical functions design .
all the processing is done the t_v_ is compu has some processing power the . so we have to we have to sell t_v_ with the remote control too . we can use this . we don't , so . because are you just wondering what controller . just the remote control . there there is there is al there there is technology like show view who is already available on most of the t_v_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because yes , that's good idea , . so the processing on on the remote controller so it can be used in any t_v_ , any conventional t_v_ sets ? the next one ? so come up with simple design , just keep the navigation buttons .
just the remote control . there there is there is al there there is technology like show view who is already available on most of the t_v_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because yes , that's good idea , . so the processing on on the remote controller so it can be used in any t_v_ , any conventional t_v_ sets ? the next one ? so come up with simple design , just keep the navigation buttons . keep the navigation but . we we don't we we don't need really much buttons to if we have screen to navigate on on the t_v_ so , four five buttons , it's sufficient . it's easy to build , it does not consume much power . but you have catch there , assume that if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . then you you go to the main menu and you have go to channel and then you can .
it's gonna be small . so it'll beep if you wanna find it you just shout just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . how bu and responds to you , and i- . just give it name and we call him . so next presentation . after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , most of the points which want to are already covered here . and to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that these are the findings which we got and adding of speech interface is always good for t_v_ remote but the technology we already know that as discussed earlier an it does how feasible it is . it will be , yes , bit complicated to make speech recognisers runs on the small ts . but if you to recognise numbers it's well-studied problem .
according to the re to the new requirements we don't need that . it is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller . so you need special t_v_ sets to do that ? or it's it's done via this remote controller ? it's very complex . it's for the industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . it's bit complex too for our next product , our new t_v_ set with automatical sound adjustment light . as discussed that four points would be good for marketing . then we can conclude that . but it's quite possible but not in this project .
the speech interface and less reasonable cost . and the lighting adaptation and the teletext . and regarding the teletext these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . if you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes . and if you are french guy watching an english movie you would like to have it in french . and if am german then would like to have the my options in german . so , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . that should be good point . but what about the the new project's requirement ? we should give up with teletext , no ?
the future demand , market demand . to desi , not not to implement it , but to , to find way to to add to add this functionality in , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . the functionality in the future . because all the t_v_ sets will be digital , . all the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change . so let's go for the the lunch break , and we will meet after .
it's it's the the shape of the of the remote . so it's it's not yo . you you will have the the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the . when you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold . it's more confog comfortable that if these it's completely flat . and the battery , is it rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? the that's the point . the kinetic one is you can recharge by the and by by just by moving the ar your arm the the remote will accumulate energy . that that's what it means by kinetic . but it's if it is feasible because if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote all the necessary energy .
we should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? but as norman say if there is already commercial product available who who do this we we can check to integrate it into our new remote control . and , this is another one where you can the the the part that's v_ standing for the volume . so there's up arrow and down arrow . but you the see that in the v_ , the v_ appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's v_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so wanna avoid this thing in the design . and here are is here is short summary that summary that compiled after the findings found . big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . and user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . so we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . you it's it's it's fine you have reviewed all all the possibilities but if we consider that the user interface is displayed on the t_v_ screen don't think we nee we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have or enter key or things like that , because adding wheels or scrolls makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so .
we have presentation . because have here just one . so got the participant three . it's the final design , . so so discussed with guillaume . and so we have and we we are both on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an or not because it's too expensive . so we come up with two versions . one with and one without l_c_d_s . but both comes with charger and then detachable and or control module . and detachable big buttons for all people .
the shared folder . sh share folder for your presentation ? we have presentation . because have here just one . so got the participant three . it's the final design , . so so discussed with guillaume . and so we have and we we are both on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an or not because it's too expensive . so we come up with two versions . one with and one without l_c_d_s .
it's not good place . no it's the all around camer microphone isn't it . the the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . is it an only single mic or microphone array ? so it's microphone array . it's very costly , microphone array . no it's just single microphone , and you we we put it here because when you when you are browsing your you will be close to t's better to to to place it here than here , . and here is little switch that control if you want the the speaker recognition system to to be on or off . and so this remote control comes up with its charger . how much does it cost this one ?
so it's microphone array . it's very costly , microphone array . no it's just single microphone , and you we we put it here because when you when you are browsing your you will be close to t's better to to to place it here than here , . and here is little switch that control if you want the the speaker recognition system to to be on or off . and so this remote control comes up with its charger . how much does it cost this one ? this this prototype is made for about fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars , but t's not it's not , but it's just prototype and if we if we optimises the the voila . it's above it's above the budget . the cost would be le reduced . the and the the production costs we we can achieve about ten dollars .
this this prototype is made for about fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars , but t's not it's not , but it's just prototype and if we if we optimises the the voila . it's above it's above the budget . the cost would be le reduced . the and the the production costs we we can achieve about ten dollars . how many battery is there ? how many , excuse me ? battery , we use about . is it the two a_a_s batteries in it . a_a_ rechargeable batteries . rechargeable , because we have the charger .
battery , we use about . is it the two a_a_s batteries in it . a_a_ rechargeable batteries . rechargeable , because we have the charger . we have the charger so it's no problem . and you just on one battery . so one one battery ? is that two or one ? it's kinetic reserve . actually it's flexible thing .
is that two or one ? it's kinetic reserve . actually it's flexible thing . now what is the whole day rating for that ? the excuse me ? whole day's rating . what type of battery ? it's just simple battery rechargeable if you like it's exist . something like two , three size batteries ? so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and leave it alone , it's alright .
the excuse me ? whole day's rating . what type of battery ? it's just simple battery rechargeable if you like it's exist . something like two , three size batteries ? so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and leave it alone , it's alright . then the next time you pick it , it works . forgot to tell you there is only single button there , this button . just explain the button norman . this button is like the mouse is like joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have click you have double click all in single button .
whole day's rating . what type of battery ? it's just simple battery rechargeable if you like it's exist . something like two , three size batteries ? so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and leave it alone , it's alright . then the next time you pick it , it works . forgot to tell you there is only single button there , this button . just explain the button norman . this button is like the mouse is like joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have click you have double click all in single button . you can move up , down , left , , or you can do swing .
it's just simple battery rechargeable if you like it's exist . something like two , three size batteries ? so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and leave it alone , it's alright . then the next time you pick it , it works . forgot to tell you there is only single button there , this button . just explain the button norman . this button is like the mouse is like joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have click you have double click all in single button . you can move up , down , left , , or you can do swing . so swing to the left , swing to the defines other functions . so even though it's single button , but it is pretty flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement .
this is the version that comes with . here present another version without the . it's not good idea because after one or two months of function is getting destroyed . this is new prototype . it's so we have the the second version also with the different button configuration . the second version is also simpler , we we had just have to put the microphone also . so it's the same . and also the switch . it's the same things as presented before . but here we have we have four buttons for navigation .
no actually we'll come to that point in our . it's it's it's embed in the speech recognition system . so so norman will explain to you . i'll i'll come to that point later on . and we will we will serve the charger with this ? they either these with the the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger . with the remote control . so the price of the charger included in the . it's standard module so you should get it for cheap price . it's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but again depends on the types .
the titanium and so it's very so the price to produce for the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such device . again and the battery life is is an is an endurable one , again because this is a_a_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . lithium-ion may be good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then the other points are robust and misplacement reminder . so when you finish watching your t_v_ and you the you you turn off the t_v_ , and then there's this message coming out that put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it that's the reminder part . and and it also use programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so ? and then because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also of t_v_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . so instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the t_v_ contents of the night . so it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . and and for the materials that is cheap to produce it's quite clear from . and also like the and the fancy designs .
two dollars for the for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . so if you sum up everything wi with the , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . we don't have charger . it's about so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about fifteen dollars . we can use excel . we don't have all the options . charger we don't have charger here either . no it's it's below the the the budget . but it's just if you want all functionalities . it's below the bu the budget .
talk about but you have the same programme on the t_v_ screen . so let's remove it . but yes exactly . then no on the t_v_ you don't it doesn't display on the t_v_ now . but this is the problem . if you have the , but if . then there is no meaning in having it on the t_v_ . or then again you have channels , volume and all the and what that depends upon your design , so so without you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? but you cannot display all on . anyway for for the users who who who opt for we'll give them the give them the , we give what the customer wants , .
to improve on the design . what about the integration of speech recognition ? the speech recogniser is add-on module . that's going to be an optional . if somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . so it's optional with the . it's an optional . it's optional , since according to this study people more likes more to have spongy remote control than . it will be it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because parents will lose these . but if you have an add-ons , the kids may just hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it .
the speech recogniser is add-on module . that's going to be an optional . if somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . so it's optional with the . it's an optional . it's optional , since according to this study people more likes more to have spongy remote control than . it will be it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because parents will lose these . but if you have an add-ons , the kids may just hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it . or parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same . in the same set , , and and individual buttons to make them work .
it inc increase . so based on that but you can make it on single p_c_ with three different options . but the the question is does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? t's about the same because if you can if you had something li no , because if you if you add something because it's three different pieces to to to build but it's it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities on the same module , but . on the same p_c_b_ . ll the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . so so so if don't don't buy now they can buy in the future . you could just provide with an optional . so in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again . so it's something like microsoft product update .
you need to look into the material . or furry like pet dog thing . so project evaluation project satisfaction , . so we finished the prototype presentation if you have something else to say . the project manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . we have to ask these question . we have to give answers so project evaluation . suppose that you this criteria , is it ? room for creativity . this room is bit small , but but it's for us to work with .
room for creativity . this room is bit small , but but it's for us to work with . feel it's fine , we know we don't need it's . that was good . this is fine for making presentat for project presentations . anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's . and the leadership was excellent . good job good job . he gave you the liberty to talk as you wants . the teamwork was very very good .
come up with new product . what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ? we know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . and also more more it's it's good idea to have clear clear points whenever we do meeting prior to the meeting to have list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but it's alright . we achieved project goal . that is within the budget . de without without , without speech recognition , it will be simple . it's yes , more or less . and the evaluation was . and the next is celebration .
we know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . and also more more it's it's good idea to have clear clear points whenever we do meeting prior to the meeting to have list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but it's alright . we achieved project goal . that is within the budget . de without without , without speech recognition , it will be simple . it's yes , more or less . and the evaluation was . and the next is celebration . so , very much . so coffee machine .
so we can't erase anything . you can erase it with the eraser , but you shouldn't delete an entire page , but just create new blank one . will delete this one now because we don't use it yet . but you can erase when you make mistake , but don't delete entire pages . and you can also let's see it's here change the colour of your pen , take blue one and change the line width like to five . that's what you will need for our first exercise , because i'm going to ask you to draw your favourite animal . it's also to gets to know each other because i'm asking three things , for that drawing , to do it on blank sheet , with different colours and showed you how to pick colour , and also with different pen widths which also showed you . and favourite characteristic can be just one word . 'm not very good at drawing , but will go first and try to draw or you should what i'm drawing , . seal , seal .
the snail doesn't have legs . and those are slow . and hope our project group will not be slow , but we will work to good result and do it as fast as we can . time for another animal . would you like to go next ? it was four months ? to make it little bit easier . make that cute . no , it's giraffe . it's easy to to recognise as giraffe .
to make it little bit easier . make that cute . no , it's giraffe . it's easy to to recognise as giraffe . the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything . and hope also reach lot with this project . so that's my favourite animal . anything else you need to know ? could you write the words , underneath it ? or more words .
no , it's giraffe . it's easy to to recognise as giraffe . the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything . and hope also reach lot with this project . so that's my favourite animal . anything else you need to know ? could you write the words , underneath it ? or more words . so draw , but . you can what it is , hope .
could you write the words , underneath it ? or more words . so draw , but . you can what it is , hope . and it's quick , . that's my favourite animal . and our final drawing . draw i've drawn dolphin because of its intelligence . one of the most intelligent animals in our world . i've i've eraser .
or more words . so draw , but . you can what it is , hope . and it's quick , . that's my favourite animal . and our final drawing . draw i've drawn dolphin because of its intelligence . one of the most intelligent animals in our world . i've i've eraser . you can try out the eraser now .
lot of buttons . always lose them . and you always lose them . lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use complex . not user friendly . search for the buttons , which one is which and . boring , it's not fun to use remote . black , all black . we should try to make it fun . they use batteries and batteries and poor signal .
things'll come up . we have some time . let's see what more have to tell you . don't think there is much left . we're starting to close . our next meeting will start 're little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes . in the meantime there's time for some individual actions . as you can see , the different roles have different tasks . and there's ping . is it my laptop ?
stop the meeting now . that's good , five minutes and the meeting's over , on schedule . meeting will close in five minutes . the marketing expert will will take look at the user requirement specification . the user interface designer will work out the technical functions design . and this was the interface designer ? or the interaction designer . or what was it , i_d_ ? interface designer , , first was . will take look at the the working design .
i'll go first . i'll go first . you can go first , . shall go first with the users ? everybody already has his presentation , so you can adjust it . is there an order ? haven't and one question , your name denni , is it with i_e_ e_i_e_ , . ja precies , ja precies , ja precies e_i_e_ . , wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . it's possibly very handy if you want to design one of those .
touch screen , . the last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . and the older people spend more money , and easily on remote control . so we have to keep in mind to to focus not lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . and on my personal preferences , don't have any mo more time to come with that , but like said , screen is easily to use because you have you can implement lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . and it should be easy to use . especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . and that is it . did everyone receive an email with the new project requirements ?
then it's good thing that made separate slide of them so you can all read them . res did not . perhaps the rest ? ja , be television . not in this presentation . should be in there . tell you them from my laptop . teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . so that's the first thing we we should pay less attention to teletext . the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and would make it more costly , .
ja , be television . not in this presentation . should be in there . tell you them from my laptop . teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . so that's the first thing we we should pay less attention to teletext . the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and would make it more costly , . our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . and last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . so we have to keep that in mind .
or with one che only the t_v_ ? only be used for television . and the video also , or not ? only the television . says only for television here , . makes it lot easier , ? so , then you can . requirements , no ? then it should have on , off , and . for standby options , ?
then it should have on , off , and . for standby options , ? the basics then by volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , teletext doesn't have to be ? and per perhaps no . yes yes sh button where you can change from one number to two numbers . two two two digits , . can you if that's got name , but . understand what you mean . it's it's easy to implement button with what which especially do that , because some t_v_s , if you press the one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , and that's that's not relaxed to user . it makes it twelve , .
and per perhaps no . yes yes sh button where you can change from one number to two numbers . two two two digits , . can you if that's got name , but . understand what you mean . it's it's easy to implement button with what which especially do that , because some t_v_s , if you press the one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , and that's that's not relaxed to user . it makes it twelve , . not really and and there are some models that don't accommodate that function . so wh the philip's television makes it possible in that to press one and then two to make the tj to reach channel twelve . so that it easy and fast .
mute misschien also . new product should reach market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers of forty plus . forties , because because younger people as younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are eighty one percent interested in screen . from twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , so to because on most recog remote controls the print plate will be broken how much , two years . you have to press very hard to go to the next channel . with the screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to for fingerprint , and then you can use it again . we we could . but that that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . because screens are very expensive . but you true .
so , true , true . but is it possible to make an screen , how was the information ? it only says that this perce percentage like screen . because , and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical . so perhaps we should we should focus on that screen . and if the only , because our target is sixteen to forty five . but will we not exceed our our production is it possible to find out , anyway ? you how much it costs . you how much it costs , the screen . no , don't have any costs here , only have percentages .
it only says that this perce percentage like screen . because , and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical . so perhaps we should we should focus on that screen . and if the only , because our target is sixteen to forty five . but will we not exceed our our production is it possible to find out , anyway ? you how much it costs . you how much it costs , the screen . no , don't have any costs here , only have percentages . or because if it only directs at the t_v_ , then you only have what you want to do with the screen . no , an screen's just like like drawn here .
you how much it costs . you how much it costs , the screen . no , don't have any costs here , only have percentages . or because if it only directs at the t_v_ , then you only have what you want to do with the screen . no , an screen's just like like drawn here . just displays several buttons , if you wanted the minimal use buttons , such as channel and volume , you just displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to press them down , just like touch screen . so you can , . so you can adjust which buttons you want on that screen . if you want to adjust , like , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings , so the other buttons are gone . we can make it possible to do that , .
no , an screen's just like like drawn here . just displays several buttons , if you wanted the minimal use buttons , such as channel and volume , you just displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to press them down , just like touch screen . so you can , . so you can adjust which buttons you want on that screen . if you want to adjust , like , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings , so the other buttons are gone . we can make it possible to do that , . so we're going for an screen ? it's the most easier thing , . and hoping that when we produce lot it won't be too expensive . had twelve fifty , , for production ?
it's the most easier thing , . and hoping that when we produce lot it won't be too expensive . had twelve fifty , , for production ? how expensive an screen is . suppose wi if the mar if our if the if the young people are interested in screens , we should make . and if that is our market share to and our goal to deliver those remote controls . but but he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , and will they use it if it only has an screen ? but , forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . but our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . so still little bit people .
but , forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . but our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . so still little bit people . but you don't want to alienate the other but if they also buy it then it's alright . no , that not now , but , so , but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . so it is ? and what else ? hope we and let's hope to reach those those sales . if it , if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then , we should be sticking to rubber buttons . can you that that they will send you some information about the cost of screens .
nothing , no costs . so if you , so if you you receive an email about that , can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in our projects mail folder . but perhaps later , so . in that should we all get the costs of everything . don't perhaps we should have backup plan that we would use buttons if it's too expensive . because you are the the marketing expert . , i'll i'll post it . but for now it's . then you have the seventy five percent of users find it ugly . and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with when remote would look fancy .
should be there , but not press , sub-menu , . it's also important to make it possible to how do you call it in english , , to not use batteries , and use ac bat batteries to to be . like with with mouse , you have not , . so you can mount the the the the remote control to to refill the . in breath it's charted . we should think of the twelve fifty we have but how much that's going to . but we don't we don't have any costs now , so . because when you get an screen , you run it on batteries , the batteries will be empty very soon , very fast . power supply is one of the most important things . you should perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off .
it says also . twelve euro twelve euro fifty . twelve fifty , twelve fifty . that's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . so it's pretty big . spread it by big market . even bigger than for . know let's do speech . let's leave out all the remote controls and just put microphone on top of the television to . you can clap .
why not why not , . is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in remote control . it's the only thing it says . but do we want to implement that , or ? an screen should be suf sufficient . but when you look at the percentages speech recognition scores even higher , ? it says lot , but no it's better to have l_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , and fifty five of those people want screen and thirty five want speech recognition . perhaps the options should be why not ? , because of the cost , but nobody knows how much it will cost . let's hope to have some we should do it .
if the costs al allow it . on one remote ? if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty . with that , but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , or ? if it should be done , if it could be done , won't matter . certain systems already exist , . then you also have to have different languages if we go international . then it's it's yours to do french and dutch and english and , . but that should also be with should be also with screen . this should be accommodated with some software , , .
if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty . with that , but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , or ? if it should be done , if it could be done , won't matter . certain systems already exist , . then you also have to have different languages if we go international . then it's it's yours to do french and dutch and english and , . but that should also be with should be also with screen . this should be accommodated with some software , , . because then in chinese is different written , volume is different written than swahili . you can use icons for the speaker and but if that's better than language for the for the remote .
if it should be done , if it could be done , won't matter . certain systems already exist , . then you also have to have different languages if we go international . then it's it's yours to do french and dutch and english and , . but that should also be with should be also with screen . this should be accommodated with some software , , . because then in chinese is different written , volume is different written than swahili . you can use icons for the speaker and but if that's better than language for the for the remote . ja , possible . so we want to it's international .
or , and then we have different languages . if it could be done , we . we have to keep . it should be done . if it could be done , should be done . that should be anything matters . that's not so difficult , because already use on several voice operated systems , and they are all possible to not all , but , , . just make separate remote for each , so we only do this when we have enough money left . you sh you should to adjust the thing . every language of dialects it's very differen difficult .
you'll have to search for it . they'd have to be easy to use . if you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options become available . the sign of it . what else can you do with television ? we've got anon have got got two examples here , but don't think there's anything we're missing . aren't we forgetting something very important ? play , pause , doesn't need to be there . we don't have the video orders , you could look here all the the , technical functions . yes , so this is your presentation .
red , white , blue , black . and see-through , that's the signal for las final five minutes . sea view , yes , simpson's versions and leave . see through version . if you press button , it turns green . so have the things read . then we have separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ? so you can program the t_v_ . perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile . so , options , and then you sub them .
because we don't have lot of buttons on the one screen , the buttons , but but or like you have you only have channel button or volume button . or do we have any buttons ? on the remote . those buttons you can you can . but that's also in the , ? no , no normal buttons , . so we don't have any normal buttons that no , alright . only the on and on and off button . yet on and off is is perhaps you kno no , no . but we don't need special we don't need special options menu for the remote itself .
on the remote . those buttons you can you can . but that's also in the , ? no , no normal buttons , . so we don't have any normal buttons that no , alright . only the on and on and off button . yet on and off is is perhaps you kno no , no . but we don't need special we don't need special options menu for the remote itself . not button , you need settings button , or settings option for the remote control . but don't think , no .
no , no normal buttons , . so we don't have any normal buttons that no , alright . only the on and on and off button . yet on and off is is perhaps you kno no , no . but we don't need special we don't need special options menu for the remote itself . not button , you need settings button , or settings option for the remote control . but don't think , no . you should be able to set which t_v_ you have . if you have if you have . but isn't idea to use what you said , normal on and off button for the t_v_ , that you don't have to use but but not for the remote but for the t_v_ , that you use but not as normal button , in the , .
there has to be on button on the remote , ? no you just tap . just tap it . touch screen , then it's turn turn off , turn on . tap the thing . and then the television is on also , or just the remote ? no , just the remote . television don't have to be on , that one you can press on , stand-by , then press on remote , press on and then t_v_ should be available . it should be in standby mode , but normal button on the remote control , or norm ? whether it's handy to have normal on button , just rubber for for t_v_ , so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel .
no you just tap . just tap it . touch screen , then it's turn turn off , turn on . tap the thing . and then the television is on also , or just the remote ? no , just the remote . television don't have to be on , that one you can press on , stand-by , then press on remote , press on and then t_v_ should be available . it should be in standby mode , but normal button on the remote control , or norm ? whether it's handy to have normal on button , just rubber for for t_v_ , so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel . otherwise you whether or not that's , .
no , just the remote . television don't have to be on , that one you can press on , stand-by , then press on remote , press on and then t_v_ should be available . it should be in standby mode , but normal button on the remote control , or norm ? whether it's handy to have normal on button , just rubber for for t_v_ , so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel . otherwise you whether or not that's , . to turn it on . of or you should put it in the screen . because when you touch the screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . wh why would it be need to have normal button ? if you use the screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you you you then turn it , and then the t_v_ goes on .
take it away . welcome you all . components design , first of all would like to accommodate some of those things elaborate some of the things did . elaborated on the concept . what should be said about the components , its properties and what materials should we use to to make one of those remote controls . first of all i've subtracted some of the components that is that are used are from what the remote control's formed . first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . would like to give you an idea of how about . don't destroy my giraffe . giraffe's gone now .
it must be recognisable . we could make little and on the top of the machine . you can put the and . so they are pretty boring , suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours and also in lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very fancy remote controls which peopl who people in which people will find they're interesting . and will buy them faster when they look at the same old grey or black colours . as said before rubber is is impossible to damage severely imp instead of you can break it when you you when you break it in with pair of scissors like that , but if you drop it it's not broken away instead of using plastic , hard plastic or titanium . and personally liked the single curved remote control , because it it makes sense . that's all about my my findings . will go next . alright so little bit about the interface .
not just p_ . p_ , just p_ . so and then the buttons above and below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . where's where's the button for two ? forgot that one . forgot something , but . and and the numbers , that should be bit larger it's not really on scale and and . an options button . and the the button for teletext apar apart because it's not really options , . it's options is the settings of the remote and of the t_v_ and that thing .
forgot that one . forgot something , but . and and the numbers , that should be bit larger it's not really on scale and and . an options button . and the the button for teletext apar apart because it's not really options , . it's options is the settings of the remote and of the t_v_ and that thing . so could call it settings . but this is bit how it . and the somewhere on the remote . perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it's better in your hand .
it was one remote , , different colours . different colours , . we should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . like my colleague , you said , is that's better , or for the elderly people something like like the ipod , with round squares . simple but easy to use . so that's it . that is my , like the older older colours . you could you could change the colours , that was also the idea . which shape you should should take , but . colours the elderly people look something like that .
you mean , like . like like this bit . so it's bit square , but it's also bit round . kinda like beer glass . so but then same sides . it's also easy to to have to to put in your hand . but that's but that's also how other remotes are shaped , so that's but perhaps that's good thing , so that's easy to use . people know the . will recognise that's as remote control . when saw your .
fresh , exciting . and the old people , old and boring . but that's easily to do with the colour , . that's easy to do with the colours , . it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape . because otherwise we have to get different shapes , and colour way easier than the shapes . in material rubber , rubber is , like said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood . so we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber . think also in between . something between that .
you can make it larger to to to with accompanying greater fields to push the button . and we won't include pen , to point , , we we want to do it with our fingers , ? your fingers , . you don't want because if you lose the pen if you lose the pen you can't use you can do whatever any cloth . you could include pen . use pen you you you can lose the pen . but people want to use remote with with their fingers because they're used to that and and we have to add tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , . the fingers , . if they t's handy to use pen . this this is good size for the screen .
or softer rubber or . that's the easy to ha to to . it bounces back from the floor where you throw it . we have different colours . this in different colours ? so the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and round shapes ? it's our main target . no don't think , it's more round than square . but it should be bit longer , perhaps . so it meets it meets more the young people than the older people .
it's our main target . no don't think , it's more round than square . but it should be bit longer , perhaps . so it meets it meets more the young people than the older people . but that's what we want , . that's our target . lower than forty years , it was . and how about my idea of making it with one single curve ? that that that was quite good . so because it's gadget and you want to show it off , .
for sound and channel . depends on the screen . we make it like this , if you put it like this . if you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . if you make it in rectangle so it's it's it's it's square . it's it's easier to have it something like button minus here , plus over here . minus here , plus over here . and on here . the other buttons and on here the top . the options and then you have something like the p_ over here , and the sound .
it's it's easy for that , where are you , but then it says i'm here . makes it possible to . but then you should also find place you could if you do it like this you could put it in corner . you can talk into the corner . not even necessary , because lotta you can make very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to just put it arou underneath it or on the on the bottom of the remote . at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also microphone over there . but , that's also . so , in the middle . but that's not import that's not im very important because , it doesn't matter where the microphone is . but you should decide where you want to put it .
no , colours are clear , shape is clear , material is clear . everybody think they can can work for that ? what's the standard colour ? and standard , we don't no we have different colour . is there standard colour ? you got you got different colours , but you should have standard colour . how many colours are we going to black . you should you should have black one because black is standard . black is is the standard . with the with the yellow just regular remote colour .
and standard , we don't no we have different colour . is there standard colour ? you got you got different colours , but you should have standard colour . how many colours are we going to black . you should you should have black one because black is standard . black is is the standard . with the with the yellow just regular remote colour . but if you want to be different , then silver . dark grey , something like this this colour . and then have different covers to use .
wrote it down here . not what to do . what to do , but . wrote it down here what to do . not what to do . the next meeting is once again in thirty minutes . here are the individual actions , and especially notice that the industrial designer and the user interface designer are going to work together on prototype drawing on smart board , and to all four of us specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach . we'll be available . but do we have to we'll work together , but do we have to stay here , or do we . i'd say just for email and find out .
we should save that one . then i'll move this one . save in the folder . save as project . no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . and we have evaluation left here . not main documents this time . have it open myself . the detailed design meeting ? we're finally getting somewhere hopefully .
just just an idea about how to that could also be possible . that's the place where it's going to be , not the size . it's an idea in so . you perhaps you should make it bit big , so people t's there and . do not forget it . to function it it doesn't really have to be sm big . the microphone could be just minor hole on the left button . we also made some ideas about how the options menu would work . using the scroll button on sides , you push the scroll button and drop down menu or pull out menu comes out and you get you get the options becoming available . you push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's remote settings , et cetera .
that's the logo of the . it's now it's only , but . would have recognised it if it were the colours . the evaluation criteria , ? full screen , . my task was this time to put up questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . my name , my job , . my name , my job . questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . one means not true , seven means true .
full screen , . my task was this time to put up questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . my name , my job , . my name , my job . questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . one means not true , seven means true . the three important things of refa are from of this year is are , is the remote control fancy enough , is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use . you used the powerpoint what ? and then evaluation itself . is the design fancy enough ?
t's looks fancy , especially with the green colour . but does it . and the the curves which we decided , ? only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? now the single curved idea was , , you ge . it it's in the background . you should make sideways view . the sideways view , that that that ma ho not that pen . it will be , . we can would smart board .
now the single curved idea was , , you ge . it it's in the background . you should make sideways view . the sideways view , that that that ma ho not that pen . it will be , . we can would smart board . not that pen . might work one time , . can draw here or . , you can .
we have to rate . is it fancy enough ? true is one , false is seven . so fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that that much now , it's only design . if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it . it's pretty fancy . and the design . especially because of the microphone and the screen also . whether older people will use it , but would make it two .
used wouldn should use that one , but it doesn't , no it's two ? but it's one . true is one . very true , is it very true or isn't that true ? 'd say two on scale no , , that's true . they t's very true , but , but we should perhaps that not . it's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , so it's very fancy , . have you ever seen remote control like this ? no , , so so it's fancy . that's fancy enough .
but it's one . true is one . very true , is it very true or isn't that true ? 'd say two on scale no , , that's true . they t's very true , but , but we should perhaps that not . it's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , so it's very fancy , . have you ever seen remote control like this ? no , , so so it's fancy . that's fancy enough . that doesn't matter that much , so make it one .
'd say two on scale no , , that's true . they t's very true , but , but we should perhaps that not . it's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , so it's very fancy , . have you ever seen remote control like this ? no , , so so it's fancy . that's fancy enough . that doesn't matter that much , so make it one . let's give it two . is it innovative ? it is , because it has an screen , mi microphone .
no , , so so it's fancy . that's fancy enough . that doesn't matter that much , so make it one . let's give it two . is it innovative ? it is , because it has an screen , mi microphone . and you use these buttons the most , ? and the scroll is rubber , so eno enough to . we have for the search function . it's from rubber .
it is , because it has an screen , mi microphone . and you use these buttons the most , ? and the scroll is rubber , so eno enough to . we have for the search function . it's from rubber . the scroller bit it's it's one . also the buttons , are they easy to find ? that was big requirement of the old people . because they're on your screen . so you can use the the the arrows .
and the scroll is rubber , so eno enough to . we have for the search function . it's from rubber . the scroller bit it's it's one . also the buttons , are they easy to find ? that was big requirement of the old people . because they're on your screen . so you can use the the the arrows . they're on your screen , so where you'd search . with the ones .
would rate it , , that's true , that's true . they are lot easier to find than than on the regular remote controls where you have to find out what which sign or icon means on every button . so you have you have to use the the the manual to understand most . but that's that's vantage of screen , you can have text . it's it's two , at least . you can make it two . two , three and what do you think ? it's not perfect , but three ? so we have two , two , three . and why is that ?
so we have two , two , three . and why is that ? personally think , because don't it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find away . if you have the button at the , don't think you can find the option button that easy . but you don't have have to use the button on the . you can touch it . you can touch it . it said bo both the options . you you can touch options . , but you have then you have here written option on here , the teletext button , ?
two , two . the the below . the next question the next question . otherwise we have two results in one question . it's easy to use , as for younger as elderl elderly people . for young people it's easy to use . young means sixteen to forty years . and elderly from forty eight to their death . it's in the entire mankind . it's the most useful remote control ever to be manufactured .
if they read manual . because that might . that's the most user friendly and easy to use . perhaps that is one of the most because lot of channel one , channel four , . because it it's not it's not it's it's not difficult . you say you say record to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the question and the answer . and that's everything it does , the speech recognition . that would make it even more easy to use for them . it would make it would make it two . so also two ?
isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed . it's not overwhelmed . remote control has colours that different that meet different target groups . 'cause we make them in different colours , so that they . and though we had about single colours , but you can also make wood colour , not just one single colour but wood-like thing , can't you ? that it that it looks like wood , like something , . also with rubber ? whether it looks like wood , it isn't it isn't wood but you can make print on rubber , can't you ? it it feels like rubber , but but then when you scratch it it does come off . so that's one then , ?
whether it looks like wood , it isn't it isn't wood but you can make print on rubber , can't you ? it it feels like rubber , but but then when you scratch it it does come off . so that's one then , ? it is it is harder to to like geez . so that's bit we have time . do you have many questions ? have the material used is spongy , that that's that's one , that's rubber . , but we have we also we have to get to the money . we're getting paid . we're getting paid .
it it feels like rubber , but but then when you scratch it it does come off . so that's one then , ? it is it is harder to to like geez . so that's bit we have time . do you have many questions ? have the material used is spongy , that that's that's one , that's rubber . , but we have we also we have to get to the money . we're getting paid . we're getting paid . , it's very spongy .
have the material used is spongy , that that's that's one , that's rubber . , but we have we also we have to get to the money . we're getting paid . we're getting paid . , it's very spongy . t's not the most spongy thing . but not it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . it's three , because you want to make it rather flexible but not too flexible , because it has screen . you can break it . remote control is hard to lose .
isn't hard to lose . so isn't hard to lose you . isn't hard to lose , . isn't hard to lose . so it's two . you can lose it , so don't you can make it three it does have an built in function . you can't lose it . or if you're you're sixty years old , your demands , also . but har hard to lose is good . so it should this question should be hard to lose .
it's two but two two two . what do you think ? it's two too , two too too . let's make everything two . in the features ? dissatisfy younger people . but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features . it has what did . because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted lot of features on this thing . that it doesn't .
dissatisfy younger people . but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features . it has what did . because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted lot of features on this thing . that it doesn't . not exactly but if it had some games on it like that , but it's for remote control it it would satisfy those needs . bu but they like the speech . the speech possibility , the colours . you could call to your , and the screen , . screen and scroll .
and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings . the easy volume up button . those are features . remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . turn turn up the volume . so i've chos shou it's it's it's one . once you've 'cause you have the channel features you have the screen features , audio features , the you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , screen extra , scroll thing extra . two or three . i'd say three , so two it is then or . make it make it two .
one on it's the colours and the it is , but what you think . x_ marks spot . and the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . it's easier to use than regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options entirely explained . tha that's so true . instead of just finding out what an icon means on button . that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . and you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with normal t_v_ remote . you can navigate . you're not satisfied , .
could ask one of you to fill it in , so that also take minutes , and the other can use that thing to count numerous functions . li like write it be , , . have to count some things and we have to think about some things . but you have to fill in this column , ? you got excel to count . no , count number of functions , because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens , so , but it's it's more about the energy source , ? dra danny , danny , i'll do that , because draw the no , no solar cell , no no no no . yea , you design it . nee one battery , with two small batteries . do you use hand dynamo , battery , kinetic or solar cells ?
you got excel to count . no , count number of functions , because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens , so , but it's it's more about the energy source , ? dra danny , danny , i'll do that , because draw the no , no solar cell , no no no no . yea , you design it . nee one battery , with two small batteries . do you use hand dynamo , battery , kinetic or solar cells ? would do battery we do . no it took battery ? one battery , ? no hand dynamo .
dra danny , danny , i'll do that , because draw the no , no solar cell , no no no no . yea , you design it . nee one battery , with two small batteries . do you use hand dynamo , battery , kinetic or solar cells ? would do battery we do . no it took battery ? one battery , ? no hand dynamo . hand on advanced chip . electronics , simple chip advanced chip , ?
would do battery we do . no it took battery ? one battery , ? no hand dynamo . hand on advanced chip . electronics , simple chip advanced chip , ? we have no , we have sample speaker . but al but we also have sample speaker , do , we already on nine . so this one and this one . we ha we have single what ?
no hand dynamo . hand on advanced chip . electronics , simple chip advanced chip , ? we have no , we have sample speaker . but al but we also have sample speaker , do , we already on nine . so this one and this one . we ha we have single what ? we have double curved . single nee single curved . double curved was see ju three dimensional .
we have no , we have sample speaker . but al but we also have sample speaker , do , we already on nine . so this one and this one . we ha we have single what ? we have double curved . single nee single curved . double curved was see ju three dimensional . but it isn't three dimensional , it isn't curved in no no no , single curved is like this . this one is this one is curved like this , . the the it's not going to work people .
we have double curved . single nee single curved . double curved was see ju three dimensional . but it isn't three dimensional , it isn't curved in no no no , single curved is like this . this one is this one is curved like this , . the the it's not going to work people . we have rubber . i'll just fill it in . it's curved like this . bu what , but we have curves like it and it .
no , we don't have push button . , we want it to it's not it's not no . fifteen , , too bad . but now button supplements . but with special colour we have . special form , ? we don't got the button supplements . we don't have any buttons , so , we need to no , we have fifteen and , . eighteen and half , damn . we have to lower it with six points .
we don't got the button supplements . we don't have any buttons , so , we need to no , we have fifteen and , . eighteen and half , damn . we have to lower it with six points . twelve and half . we could lose the curve . we could use we should scrap the sample speaker . would lose the curve . we could lose the scroll wheel . you could make it just regular scroll wheel .
normal scroll wheel . and we should lose the curve . lose , so we don't exactly need the single we don't need curve . it's four pri it four units . but if you would it is new feature , it it's something special . but wha curved then it will be square . no , the curve doesn't really no , then it will won't stand up from the table . 's possible to lose curve . then it would just . was that does that mean to it , single curve ?
that's meant with scr with curve . the curve is in dimension . if you make it flat one , it's no curve , you got no curves . so we would lose this one ? but tha that that only is one . we could , bit . no , two . no , one . sixteen point three . so we don't , we also have to no , otherwise we don't have an screen .
is it possible to make no . ma you just can't do that , or we changed , and the single curved to uncurved . and what did you change ? you changed the scroll wheel and , but it's just one point , so you should should , you should you should drop the speech recognition . so that does doesn't doesn't that mu scrap sample speaker ? that that's yes , four points . the sample speaker is two , four points . but it's , but it is it it is new feature , it is something special . and then you can keep the curve . or can't you ?
no , that's no . make it when you made it remote control of wood ? it it , it also it also takes one point less . you don't make remote control of . we could make it titanium instead of rubber . but wooden remote control only helps for old people we discussed , yes ? can ask something ? what is special colour ? is that the wood wood this , we have to have that one too ? but it's only half .
it it , it also it also takes one point less . you don't make remote control of . we could make it titanium instead of rubber . but wooden remote control only helps for old people we discussed , yes ? can ask something ? what is special colour ? is that the wood wood this , we have to have that one too ? but it's only half . but the only option is to drop the sample speaker . to knock the sample speaker , .
but it's only half . but the only option is to drop the sample speaker . to knock the sample speaker , . and sample sensor . then we still have too much if we use the , we we scrap that one ? but , course , but what we'll have . let's make it thirteen or fourteen . see , po three . we need point three . that's scroll wheel .
special colours , fruity colours . it's also green or , but it's special colour than just rubber colour . is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours . normal colours , yellow , but then don't think we can ever make to twelve and half . you have to add something to the rubber to make it green . you don't say here's green rubber . they don't sell green rubber plants . you can , you should you have to lose no , it is the scroll wheel , . but then we have to scrap display , we have to scrap advanced chip . no no no .
you pay half per remote . , and you one colour per remote . so each remote with special colour . so then it is one . you don't need four of those four of those special colours in one in one remote . true , true . we have two points spare . so the battery , we have advanced chip on print . nee one point . so it would be curved , single curve .
it's too bad for the speaker . so it's curved , it's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . should we change that tha that that's one if not , or not ? we dropped the scroll wheel . could you copy it ? and make it the entire perhaps you can then copy page or so . and the rest is the same , ? yea the scroll wheel is dropped . you you made the entire could you not . undo , undo .
we dropped the scroll wheel . could you copy it ? and make it the entire perhaps you can then copy page or so . and the rest is the same , ? yea the scroll wheel is dropped . you you made the entire could you not . undo , undo . by the perhaps you can save this one , and then copy . add it copy page . no , but you .
yea the scroll wheel is dropped . you you made the entire could you not . undo , undo . by the perhaps you can save this one , and then copy . add it copy page . no , but you . alright , something went wrong . but this this new remote we can afford . it doesn't work . it should've work .
no , hadn't . when did you receive this list ? they don't work so hard at the finance department . suppose this is , so we lose the scroll wheel , the and the microphone . so too bad . and that's it . and we changed something , , or not ? twelve euro fifty . and did you try to make new design , or what were you trying to do ? tried to copy that one , but it didn't work .
twelve euro fifty . and did you try to make new design , or what were you trying to do ? tried to copy that one , but it didn't work . it didn't work . so we could fix it like tha that it's like this . you could select it all , but then you can't erase . you can arrange , can't you then just say copy ? you can only re erase ? when you saw li earlier when we selected it , couldn't erase anything . just tap somewhere .
deadlines were sometimes very short . bu but stressful . but and stressful . you think , no , my presentation isn't ready . we it should be it would be better if we worked little bit together . now we worked through each other , something he said , and you had information also had , so some some things had in my presentation , they already told , so so , that don't think that is the best way to work at for such project . and you could ask things . you had information didn't have and then . and for me it sometimes was surprise who was going to present what , ? so you would say communicate during our individual work .
that wasn't me . so the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about this digital pen ? used it , it it was you can use it , it's quite handy . didn't use it . use it as normal pen and and and only you use it to get it on the computer , ? but didn't used it too , but . used it to to , it did work pretty . don't think why you would want to use it actually , but it it does work . because it shou to make some designs , it is very easy . it is it is , it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer .
used it , it it was you can use it , it's quite handy . didn't use it . use it as normal pen and and and only you use it to get it on the computer , ? but didn't used it too , but . used it to to , it did work pretty . don't think why you would want to use it actually , but it it does work . because it shou to make some designs , it is very easy . it is it is , it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer . and then you can show it to everybody . but to write it .
team work was . it was , . only thing that we worked through , past each other . we , but that was it was our assignment , ? with some things that was only problem , but , but furthermore better . but it was because we didn't . and should walk out of the room when you discuss this point , the leadership . that's , no prob . it was good , but . not too much , not too too too too .
with some things that was only problem , but , but furthermore better . but it was because we didn't . and should walk out of the room when you discuss this point , the leadership . that's , no prob . it was good , but . not too much , not too too too too . when we look at this i'd say we have been creative , ? but there was room for you did ? or the room for it was the idea to be creative , so you got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out . and you get get from the from the computer , but .
not too much , not too too too too . when we look at this i'd say we have been creative , ? but there was room for you did ? or the room for it was the idea to be creative , so you got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out . and you get get from the from the computer , but . the information was sometimes little bit too late or . little bit lo . too late it it it took lot of time before you got your ema . you just sit there for ten minutes . where is that email ?
played seven times solitaire something . didn't have time for that . is it on there ? wha , it is there . is it on there ? didn't find the didn't look but didn't look , but got like one email after ten minutes . at some times sometimes received like like five emails at at one moment , and then even got spam . was searching and searching . no , never got that . that's what we said .
and it not lot no , the first one . no , didn't know make . like with with the remote and never new we have we had to made made rec remote control . didn't know nee . and didn't to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , so went , . so so , . no stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page . and was working and working and work , but after all we can say we are satisfied , but it it could've been better . just looking at the screen and , an , that will be handy . when we get when we have we would have gotten more information .
think that's about it . we got it already . heavier less heavy laptops . they're pretty heavy . they were they were just fine . but that's not really . and furthermore the the the network was . everything you loaded was also av available there . and so more time might have improved the the quality of work , is what you say . but that it's now half past four half past three , so , .
have we also have to go to our own rooms again , but at least . we have to fill in questionnaire again , but we do ? but you can try to make screen shot of this , so try to include it in the final report . that that one ? you cannot you can save it . you can just , but it's it isn't picture or , , is it ? wants to , but at least this one . know , we should remove this , but it won't . you file save as the j_ peg j_ peg . and put it in the project folder then , .
wants to , but at least this one . know , we should remove this , but it won't . you file save as the j_ peg j_ peg . and put it in the project folder then , . can you find it as j_ peg ? no , isn't possible . but you can make screen shot , . hereby officially close the meeting and hope to see you soon . in celebra or shouldn't ? in about five minutes .
no , isn't possible . but you can make screen shot , . hereby officially close the meeting and hope to see you soon . in celebra or shouldn't ? in about five minutes . we'll be bit bit longer , but . happy celebration , ? let's let's have party . how big do you want the images ? let's have some fun .
in about five minutes . we'll be bit bit longer , but . happy celebration , ? let's let's have party . how big do you want the images ? let's have some fun . not too big . whatever you good . no that is one thousand twenty four . eight hundred six hundred is better .
let's let's have party . how big do you want the images ? let's have some fun . not too big . whatever you good . no that is one thousand twenty four . eight hundred six hundred is better . if it browse . nah , name . isn't on the desktop .
let's have some fun . not too big . whatever you good . no that is one thousand twenty four . eight hundred six hundred is better . if it browse . nah , name . isn't on the desktop . do not know . you can only save it in my documents .
it's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here . no , that's . joost , your mouse . no mouse needed ? i've got touch-pad . do how how wake it up ? no , my laptop . you with your brilliant ideas . if touch the power button . do how how wake it up ?
we al already been through that part . it consists of three levels of design . we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . every level of design consists of some individual work , and we close it with meeting . you all received an email with example of our explanation of what the particular level of design means to the different functions , and you you probably read that already , so don't have to tell you about that . first we're gonna gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these meeting tools . we have the smart-boards , the thes those two boards . this is the presentation boards , wh which one i'm using now . you can there's document folder called the sh shared document folder . you can upload your documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your powerpoint presentations on this screen .
just on the on the screen over there . no , saw saw the file , the smart-board that x_b_k_ but . probably is , but if the software is on the laptop . is is if it's mainly thing for in the meeting , so don't t's if it's important . this an explanation of the smart-boards . there is tool-bar over here . it's quite simple . you have the the pen function , eraser function . it's like very simple paint application . we , we use the same file during the whole day , and you can make new sheets by by pu puttin pressing on the blank button .
i'll go next . haven't got favourite animal too , so . what should draw ? i'll draw penguin . i'll draw penguin . 't draw , so you can start to laugh already . i'll do so . something like that . it's little bit hard . it's better than your bird .
wouldn't call it training , but alright . this is something about the project finance . the selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five euros . and our profit aim is fifteen million euros . we're very ambitious on this one . the market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be maximum of twelve euro fifty per remote control . so that's clear . we're now gonna discuss some when , we're gonna brainstorm about what kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . do you have good experiences with remote controls ?
don't don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new t_v_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . and then different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions are removed , or whatever . so what we need is is clear remote control with grouped buttons , . all all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to , , to minimise it to this this or whatever other functions somewhere else . different functions of of . we should group them . and same for the for the volume buttons and the the was was thinking since t_v_ is mostly used together with v_c_r_ or d_v_d_ player or recorder , and not with stereo , it should be good to include functions for v_c_r_s and d_v_d_ players , recorders . and , is it gonna be remote control that's what it can be used for different equipment , like your t_v_ and your home stereo ? but , the d_v_d_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . it's what , from my experience .
not it was only for television . so so we probably don't have to have to have the functions for d_v_d_ player or v_c_r_ . yes , it is only for television , but ll we we're gonna brainstorm about that . if we t's useful , we do it . in the email . it said , television remote control . it's television remote control . but was thinking since it is useful with d_v_d_ . yes , yes , that's something extras . but most television remote controls support other functions as .
to go with to go with fashion and team leader . can opener underneath it ? for the bear . or someth something special , like m_p_ three player inside of it , or , then the production costs are gonna be too high probably . no it , yo we have to keep it simple , to get whole market . way too high . it's international , so we have to use standard . with different type of fronts or , has to be something spectacular or one which makes it we gonna skip back to the goals probably . that's an idea , . original , trendly , and user-friendly , we al also already talked about user-friendliness .
t's you dumped the file in the in the sh in the project document folder . i've done that . you've already done that ? no can that open . let's close this one . we'll just open new one . open it there . have to say something . due to some technical problems haven't digitized the last the meeting minutes . but i'll make that happens next time .
no can that open . let's close this one . we'll just open new one . open it there . have to say something . due to some technical problems haven't digitized the last the meeting minutes . but i'll make that happens next time . about the get . and i'll get this one in digital form too . we're going to talk about working design .
but nothing restricted for user interface ? no , it's it's just part of known technology , . remote control is nothing special nowadays . regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . doesn't really matter . don't , because of the all the televisions there are few couple of televisions with the new functions , but is it useful to put them on on standard remote ? the technical functions . we'll see later on . if you got the same pictures as got , but got these two , and they're we have to focus on the one hand the expert view or the novice user . it's it's very much depending on the user requirements , don't know who's doing , but it that's very important to watch what functions there we want to put in remote control .
the technical functions . we'll see later on . if you got the same pictures as got , but got these two , and they're we have to focus on the one hand the expert view or the novice user . it's it's very much depending on the user requirements , don't know who's doing , but it that's very important to watch what functions there we want to put in remote control . will there be some user requirements later on ? the ones i've received from the account manager . we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on . we can put functions in it when , when we get the user requirements and we can update it . but this real this big distinction between this type of remote . we should we should choose one we should not compromise but really choose for expert viewer or novice ?
yes , agree . what that's what you want trying to say . if you want try huge market , if you want to reach huge market , like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user . it's it's really depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in in use . some of these , . some of that will , but but it will be more clear when we come to the some of the new requirements . there are at least basic functions , like just the channels one till nine , on and off switch , which must be clear with red button like that . most standard have volume , , and mute function , and , , the next and previous channel . that's just basic what we need . and from that on we can user requirements what we need more .
you will have to look that up . the slogan puts fashion in electronics . i'll have look . we put the fashion in electronics . it's something about the , . it might be , let's make things better , but , let's go back to the the agenda . sense and simplicity . so we've now had to the three presentations . we know about the new project requirements . that means we can , discuss on the remote control functions .
but you can put them under the same button . not much more than that . if as far as possible . or we can we could put behind the flip-flap or whatever . but what do you think ? do should we implement features that or functions that to control other devices ? no , you don't ? no , new requirements say no . the new requirements say so . so , but if it's too simple they won't use the remote control , they use their own with lot more functions .
we can make joystick . something or somethin special way to to zap through the it has to it has to be , and quick . you have to use it very quickly . it was true . if you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus . and it the buttons should make it possible to to zap through your channels in rapid at rapid pace . what should we decide on then ? in in case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which weren't worked out already , but it shouldn't be problem then . but no , it's just signals and the television does the rest . we the batteries .
about twenty minutes . ten twenty minutes . but in way we have to be special . these these shouldn't . but that's that's do you have you have you think about tha thought about that ? how we can what the extra touch can be . for the remote control . do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget feature or , it was something about how we lose them . it should be remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget thing . that's that's more for for an age range or ten to twelve or whatever .
how we can what the extra touch can be . for the remote control . do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget feature or , it was something about how we lose them . it should be remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget thing . that's that's more for for an age range or ten to twelve or whatever . to find him . nah , lot of people like to have such kind gay things . it it should be like birthday present that you give someone , and it is has something . , that's good one , . or it should have big light that can flash on it , or it should or an or the like the the can opener .
but that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second or you can . fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control . but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it , . no , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in . on the television . if an button in in that , you can ma make rechargeable one , . and then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it chargeable . that , but , the pro no , that it might be , nee but we don't . you , but we much about production cost , but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five euros on remote control and it's basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that st , rechargeable units . it should only cost twelve and half euros , .
yes , definitely . yes , but is that handy ? t's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . it's it's it's it's it's not the purpose to be handy , it's . and you can always find your remote control up , . but but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last two years , three years , with with two batteries . , you could when that's when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , but you will you do need also an , also you would need battery in the the base unit as , . and then you yes . does it makes it kinda , . you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , .
t's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . it's it's it's it's it's not the purpose to be handy , it's . and you can always find your remote control up , . but but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last two years , three years , with with two batteries . , you could when that's when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , but you will you do need also an , also you would need battery in the the base unit as , . and then you yes . does it makes it kinda , . you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , . or but you pay for it . but that's not it's ugly , .
and then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo i've experienced that that , . most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes . so , easy functions . we will we will we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi . but it's also annoying . 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it . then it beeps all the time and . no , that's true . you don't want to have ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable . and you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it .
i'll fifteen minutes . something like that , . but we're we're done . we've decided on the functions . there is some . there is closing sheet . we have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work . i'll make i'll had some problems with the digitising the the first minutes , the the the next minutes won't be problem , but i'll try to make the first one will be in the folder too , but it won't work , but you'll see . these are more important than the first ones , so . can you make an part of folder for the minutes ?
that not not everything in one one folder . maarten , five minutes . because did the first minutes did were were were bit scratchy , . then did second one with nicer layout , which could , know , use for the other ones , but think forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write second it's get it's not working when you try to write second paper . no , that's true , . and then you you had to overwrite it or someth . becau , it was not my pen . should we by the way draw on our whiteboard , little idea of . this looks you like . of the shape .
probably , it would be . has anyone got little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? don't , for one . like this pen . bit bigger , but the shape is , it's something different , and we want we want that . no , bigger . little bit bigger , but , look look at the pictures . it has to feel in your hand . have to say , have this can opening remote control in my head most of all , or some we should no , that will be too costly . we shou we could also , that was would also be an idea , but don't if it exists already , you should like make alessi design it .
don't , for one . like this pen . bit bigger , but the shape is , it's something different , and we want we want that . no , bigger . little bit bigger , but , look look at the pictures . it has to feel in your hand . have to say , have this can opening remote control in my head most of all , or some we should no , that will be too costly . we shou we could also , that was would also be an idea , but don't if it exists already , you should like make alessi design it . that would also be . but that's gonna then you then you don't , but then you don't have it that's not something that's in the production cost one it's one time , was it's single cost .
no , bigger . little bit bigger , but , look look at the pictures . it has to feel in your hand . have to say , have this can opening remote control in my head most of all , or some we should no , that will be too costly . we shou we could also , that was would also be an idea , but don't if it exists already , you should like make alessi design it . that would also be . but that's gonna then you then you don't , but then you don't have it that's not something that's in the production cost one it's one time , was it's single cost . but twelve and half euros ? but but then you can nah , don't thin that it would be more expensive , because i've bought the alessi more often and even small pencil holders are more expensive . would be idea though .
how we're , ring of no , no , you have to on the side of it . ro roun rounds . side of it . along the side strip of . just two leds on the side . lights also around the volume and the the plus minus programme buttons . but also meant the the blinking li , the ones that also blink when you try to locate your remote . theys have to be . probably at the side . look at the front , but , exactly , and then there is .
titanium is probably trendy , . that's true , . little bit expensive . they don't tell anything about the cost of titanium . the chip the chip set and the board is all off the shelf . also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are just available in in our factory . i've told about the three first points . the simple electronical chip is is available with the led transmitter transmitter . it's all off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all available in our company .
most the most used buttons . those are probably the the yes . it puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to to make these two most basic functions extra big , like . those are probably the four most most used buttons on the in the remote control . you did the research . and you want to acc accentuate that , . it's from your research . that was all personal preference didn't have . didn't had any time left . no , that's coo it's .
no , put them there to , , for general idea . and , the docking st the spongy material is is very irritating for the remote control itself . but to , the to implement some spongy thing , we can do it in the in the docking station . at the bottom of the docking station or whatever . and , we could bring one line with dark colour to how do you say ? also bit for elderly people who are little bit crazy and want want little younger design but still the dark colour . no , but that our design already resembles so piece of fruit . how but how do we use fruits and vegetables in christ's sake with remote control ? it it it reaches different market , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to to bring like black r_c_ on the market or whatever . there's there's always there there's always empty space on remote control .
it it it reaches different market , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to to bring like black r_c_ on the market or whatever . there's there's always there there's always empty space on remote control . make it banana ? it's like pear . this part of the r_c_ the upper the upper part or whatever is is not not used with buttons , . no , don't think you have to do it like , but it that doesn't have to remind you , , like explicitly of our of of specific piece of fruit , but just , , like the the the the round curves . so you you can put some fruity things no , not . and so this it already sem resembles something like pear to me . but , but that , but that's but don't we need creative artist like that to make it to feel like vegetable or fruit ? if we make it little bit greenish .
if we make it little bit greenish . you do get the idea , ? the fruity round . and we could use one of these for the what is it ? isn't wha whatever . we have we have very big the of design team , . we can we can we can produce multiple multiple things . for big team of artists . this is then the pear . the english word , so forget it .
conceptual design , yes . see what was on the agenda . this is his own remote . because , we can start with the technical functions , but don't t's there , , do we want to use an display , ? only if we we can make t_v_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . but don't what to display on it . but it should be li like this big , and don't think yes , but it it has to to show an entire title of programme or at least quite quite large part of it and then you get very large screen , because , . but it's so don't think we should do it . no , no , only the t_v_ channel with the with with four programmes . you can zap through them with the page up page down button .
only if we we can make t_v_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . but don't what to display on it . but it should be li like this big , and don't think yes , but it it has to to show an entire title of programme or at least quite quite large part of it and then you get very large screen , because , . but it's so don't think we should do it . no , no , only the t_v_ channel with the with with four programmes . you can zap through them with the page up page down button . yes , it can on your no , on your mobile phone you can you can read text also . so why not on your remote ? do it's bit redundant , actually . and it's also not don't even it looks like sexy , it's but you're already watching the t_v_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control .
do it's bit redundant , actually . and it's also not don't even it looks like sexy , it's but you're already watching the t_v_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control . ll what would you display on it then ? programme information or or or or or guide on on teletext , yes . but is it isn't that already on t_v_ , lot of new t_v_s ? but lot lot of t_v_s show when you zap to but then we also need to bring out line of t_v_s which we were planning to , but whatever . also on the internet . but yes , but you also want to 's next . and we also have to . because the t_v_ has to send information back to the r_c_ , and if that's possible .
programme information or or or or or guide on on teletext , yes . but is it isn't that already on t_v_ , lot of new t_v_s ? but lot lot of t_v_s show when you zap to but then we also need to bring out line of t_v_s which we were planning to , but whatever . also on the internet . but yes , but you also want to 's next . and we also have to . because the t_v_ has to send information back to the r_c_ , and if that's possible . yes , that's really possible . yes , yes , it's possible , but you gotta implement it in the t_v_s , and don't think everyone's gonna buy real reaction t_v_ within month after the release of our remote control . and also , .
then you push button . the title and the information about the programme . about that programme ? but but , what he said was , about the televisions , they have to be customised to the but in future it will be giant hit , and when you are the first you have the biggest yes , you can put little display on it with with lots of information . i've seen it done before . do like the the bigger rem universal remotes , they have displays , but then it's very functional to indicate which what device you are controlling . so it's that that's what i've seen . that's true , if you . but it just it it doesn't doesn't match with the our whole basic concept . but haven't thought about it .
we skip the display . no , it's too much . it's little too much , . i'm , you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement . mayb will rule the world with it . but probably so . but for the technical part . the material , it was good idea to use the plastic and the rubber . yes , bit of cushion is yes . this is what it , but it it was already what we're we're after , , to give it , , the soft touch in your hands and also to , know , like , that is the airbag thing .
makes it in homogeneous design . no , not all , not all of them . but it it then it you can't throw it it . it will make huge noise or break other when you throw with titanium with your remote control . it will it will break other when it's plastic , as . no , titanium is bit it's bit harder . no , but , you should ma . but also on the colours , the young yes , but titanium remote control , when you're watching t_v_ or your hands are little bit sweaty , and the yes . think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium . would it be more trendy ?
it it does . titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic . in trendy things . on the other hand , if you want to make fruit fruity with , that's true , that's true . it's cold in the winter . but really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big thing . but the question is then it's , , is is it fits in our philosophy to make it sturdy and simple and , know , like when you make it titanium , it becomes more like some gadget you actually don't need . sports and gaming . and when it's big and plastic , it's like some fun you can always have around . it's always fun to have something big and plastic around .
didn't got it yes . but you can't make the plastic give the ti titanium look . but make it just like shiny . we should shou and and we sh should we if we should talk about , how how much time have we got left ? like the m_p_ three player . that's good idea , . but if you want to la , last longer than two weeks like that , you can . in lot of other in lot of other product categories like even in in bags industry . what time does the rubber . they began with typical leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all colours , and fon of of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it like eastpack began revolution with it with all this bags and and colours and and yes , and and styles .
like the m_p_ three player . that's good idea , . but if you want to la , last longer than two weeks like that , you can . in lot of other in lot of other product categories like even in in bags industry . what time does the rubber . they began with typical leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all colours , and fon of of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it like eastpack began revolution with it with all this bags and and colours and and yes , and and styles . you putting in different colours . they have also roses on it , and then we can always use the same design for greater resemblance , but with new with new colours , new yes . but , let's think about the bas , . new prints on it .
like two-tone colour ? there there are three components three components type . the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , and the cushions as should be in another colour . no , not too much . you have the buttons , the the case itself , and the rubber and yes . how the buttons . or you just make one colour , with like big wave like in in another colour . but not more than , , it's no . not more than two colours . no , definitely not .
but not more than , , it's no . not more than two colours . no , definitely not . it's little bit too flashy . we should talk about it on in later meeting . yes , definitely . or or when you use the buttons as black , it you can use two colours as but then you have to put up and down and left and . but we have to think of some other important things . the the functionalities of the the buttons . the funct , was was thinking about the st do we still want joystick idea .
no , that's too vulnerable . this is , the so we have the basic . then we have the numbers . we have the power button . we have we have teletext button . the volume , teletext and , , but wha what menu ? and want to access menu . but that's that's was thinking that's gotta be on the television . most t_v_s have menu . but you ha really need menu button .
and want to access menu . but that's that's was thinking that's gotta be on the television . most t_v_s have menu . but you ha really need menu button . that's just the only button only , no , most t_v_s have an menu nowadays to access the screen settings . is isn't that different from every television ? if it's if , it's to to add menu button for and if the t_v_ doesn't have menu , then . and so but that that covers all the all the other settings . it covers everything then . you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever .
we've made prototype . we've got our aspects from the last meeting . especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . we've drawn here the prototype . the logo is is is pretty obvious to see on the on the remote control , but it is necessary when you want to build your company to level higher . our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . you can point them the functions . the all the functions are discussed the most of the functions are obvious . it's little bit . then the the the nine channels .
but that it's here then , in the middle . alright , and you gotta point out which is the volume button and which is the programme button . yes , we've disc most of the users yes , there there will be little little p_ on that and little . mo mo , most of them are right-handed . but you you gotta make it clear on the on , and and triangle on that . don't have time in anymore on the , just progr programme above , . next to that kinda miss zero actually . there's was one thing wanted to ask . there are different ways for remote controls to do like call it teens and twenties . the two numbers .
do know so . is it depending on television ? nah , don't really , because you have know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , you can still select the twenty number in the twenty or in the ten . yes , but no remote control nowadays are they come with the television . or actually , the other way around . no , really t's because you can when when you put button on it with like one and then dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , because it it first gives you the functionality of that that separate button you also had to apply . but su if no no no . because that's it's for television . it's exact the same thing . so some television respond differently .
no , no . it's more is we don't we both don't really understand how it how it really works , but there's more to in than wha than what you just said . remote control sends one signal at one button press . do think that t_v_s support mur multiple remote controls . some some televisions when when you want to go further than ten no , you have to you have to give the television two or more signals . won't work wi with to have that special button . when you press one button , you give one signal . and the older televisions need more signals to go level higher . but when you make the technology that that it will give more signals , it could work , but just basic idea of of of the most most most common and simple operations on the remote . kinda miss the docking station .
but let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because we have we have to consider the docking station anyway , because we have some cost issues still to come . you could make like hole in it , , of in in the . that that is possible , . and the the look and feel would be on this remote control , because you always will pick up the remote control in the in the smallest area . but we have to look . don't like the colours . then your left thumb of your thumb is near the programme button , which is the most common used function , and all the other buttons are available for your thumb . so it's it's it's really good design . yes , on the side there will be strip of rubber , and in the middle there is hard hard material , bit hard plastic with light behind it . and other lights ?
added lights are gonna be problem too . yes , we can make also neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make light on it . no , on the on the front . the the logo . but , it will also use batteries , and do we want to the all the aspects of the interface buttons were yes . for now , this is is good enough . what was on the , but in the , the colour , because we're gonna use one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , isn't it ? then we're gonna do the buttons in the are we're gonna have rubber buttons . and they're be they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . in the same colour as the side .
then we're gonna do the buttons in the are we're gonna have rubber buttons . and they're be they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . in the same colour as the side . that'll be good . and we should use darker colour for the plastic , and some more brighter and flashy , we'll talk about the lights later . yes , we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use multiple lights , so it will yes . 'cause also don , it's depends on the costs and such . but , and we have to agree upon the exact colours , but may if that's important , but we'll talk about that later . for now this is this is . the next you gonna give presentation too ?
we can make it one . yes , but what is it ? two or three . two or three . go for the positive . was was thinking about three , so three is bit , what am doing ? so go for two . was thinking about four , so three is , let that let's make that one . i'll mark it . the remote control's that makes zapping easy .
i'll mark it . the remote control's that makes zapping easy . antek , you agree ? i'll i'll agree . that's one thing for . you're not antek . i'm the i'm the usability , so . the remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible . two or one , . the , menu , .
i'll i'll agree . that's one thing for . you're not antek . i'm the i'm the usability , so . the remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible . two or one , . the , menu , . it's something we really put work into . would say one because every button is relevant . it's all about the buttons .
and the light . but we have we have to talk about the lights . and the light . but that that's not innovative . but , six . and don't also it's also really not innovative , it's more no , six . it's not seven ? lights lights are six . or seven , . no , six .
lights lights are six . or seven , . no , six . why why not seven ? mine is seven . because we've tried to make it little bit innovative , but it but it with the lights it it's it's future but still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the with yes . it's depends on the on the no , actually it's seven , but there's nothing innovative about it . you think the lights are innovative ? agree , but i'll , you you didn't draw the docking station . innovative in generally or just original for docking station is innova .
that , for the retrieval function . that's very innovative for remote control . , more through like function t_v_ functionalities and no no , what . to put it on your head . you have must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control , not in how you find your . but but definitely don't t's five , but remote control is easy to use . it's that's that's think about it la later on and , as one or two ma at least . the remote control hasn't got . no , would have seen that one before . you skipped one , here .
just in general . no no no . no , just if they if they buy it . but yes , two , but only in when you compare it with with elderly . what do you think ? that is not the question . no , that's no comparison . it's just it will be bought by people under forty . you can , you can be very picky about it . and don't mean two people .
you can put that on the side if if we would like to . yes , encrypted with yes . and will still t's gonna be two or three . are we gonna do that ? three this time . because of the slogan remote control's got basic design intended for novice users . and , it's one or two . make it two . we gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . four , five , seven , nine .
this was my evaluation . because still think that the most important part of this meeting still has . so we did pretty job until now . is this your whatever . is there something after this meeting ? we gotta fill out another questionnaire . still opened or . because received spreadsheet . but actually don't need this presentation , . i'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because didn't really fin have .
we gotta fill out another questionnaire . still opened or . because received spreadsheet . but actually don't need this presentation , . i'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because didn't really fin have . didn't really finish it . we we'll see . we'll stumble upon some problems . we probably will . probably have already opened it here .
whoa , it's little that's huge . that's bit of problem , because re but really don't understand that , because imagine remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this sheet . we have the simplest buttons . no , it's only when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . don't , because it says amount . if you use scroll-wheel it's the push-buttons . it wouldn't fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost . the the the yellow row is the amount of to that's total of four buttons . and count them like this . you can have four push-buttons .
but the problem now is that the there's no such thing as docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make docking station for thirty cents . but we can sell the remote control and sell the docking station yes . se no no no . and and but we don't have to tell it , but what we can say of can almost make it impossible to buy remote control without the docking station . but do like the idea , but we . it but it then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we need . no , but you otherwise you can't retrieve it . really don't get it . if it's simple chip , then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents . we can agree on this .
but for two euros and thirty cents , we we don't get docking station . so , too . because when we don't need docking station , then probably we also have only we also need simple chip . and then we can get docking station . and then we can do something extra . for for two euros . , still , it's gonna get more expensive with . then we have some money left . we can put then we can put scroll-wheel on it . if you if it would cost two euros , that had total total thing , it would be too , we're not gonna add trip to hawaii to it .
or we can ki do the kinetic cells . that's also an idea . that's what then what he has to find out . you can find it in your email now , then we know then we exactly it will cost us . if if regular chip and because we don't have special functions to use in advanced chip , . is that that's to know . bu bu but when we , but when we skip when we when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still , we need something else to make it special , because that was our our special feature . like the hand dynamo part . we can make plain docking station for two euros . we'll go back tomorrow .
it's on it . don't think here it's in here already . it's circuit board . it's only just basics for for at the end circuit there is an infrared led . it's nothing about . this isn't helpful . but in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . which one was it ? yes , that was mine . no , that was my presentation .
yes , that was mine . no , that was my presentation . yes , it was the second one . but that was my second but this is the same this is only the possibilities . it was your second your first presentation . it's already open . it's at the bottom . it's at your task bar . but it's the the other one . this is this is not this that's not the one .
no , this is the other one . or something is there's something abo in in these here . we can use simple , regular , or advanced chip . the display requires an advanced chip . it doesn't say anything . that push-button requires simple chip , but scroll-wheel , it it me requires , so we only need simple chip . with the light . but that that's just the same as the the led . no no , that's just simple chip . that's not needed .
you can say against the remote page page up , page down . that's not too what we want . we might want it , but . all in twelve euros . back to the costs . twelve euros and fifty cents . so we're gonna use the simple chip . so , simple chip is . and the lights . where are the lights ?
lights , , there's no category . there're three , . nah , there is some money left to be spent . can we do it wi within two two euro ? we can make docking station . but what we have to think about now is that is is it still special remote control ? but it isn't it hasn't got any innovative technology , we aren't gonna apply any innovated innovative te technology anyway , . don't don't see any possibility to do so , because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy . but it's original . but what is there some extra the kinetic thing is something .
we can make docking station . but what we have to think about now is that is is it still special remote control ? but it isn't it hasn't got any innovative technology , we aren't gonna apply any innovated innovative te technology anyway , . don't don't see any possibility to do so , because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy . but it's original . but what is there some extra the kinetic thing is something . no , that's true . instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to know , so so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore . bu or the hand dynamo dynamo . we if we put the kinetic thing in it , you leave the , know , but still they will think about that .
can't we can't we say fifteen euros ? no , sta no . no , we only make less profit of it . it's the we can can do it both . you can sell for twenty seven and half . then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and half production costs . don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it like still fee also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the , it it gives something dynamic to the remote control . don't think no . we can do it both in the in the in the remote . battery and kinetic .
because the whole dynamic part , do , appeals to me qui thinking of our design philosophy , , with the rubber parts and sturdiness of the thing , and when you move it around lot , then people find the idea funny that when move my remote control around and , but you don't have to . it's funny for week . something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . the idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens . no , don't move my my remote control very much , . then we , we don't have to do it , but what that would just have lack of key features , . you have to put something on your box . you have to make people buy it and we can really can do the docking thing , it's not , we can do it , but it's would be easy way out . you can do it for fifty cents . we've got more than fifty cents .
no no there's still there's still someth concept and something special left . the no , but no . we're gonna it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and looks and feel . that's what it's makes it special . and would li would have liked kinetic part as , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and will work , but it's it's an they're they're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen . why not hand dynamo then ? leave it like this . then it's then we're . we can't do anything else . warning , finish meeting now .
leave it like this . then it's then we're . we can't do anything else . warning , finish meeting now . project , we were gonna what look take look at the last sheet . is this it ? no , we can't . we have to , it's , . yes , yes . don't see why , but we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest .
is this it ? no , we can't . we have to , it's , . yes , yes . don't see why , but we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest . where's the champagne ? don't hear bell . no , not yet . alright , i'll see you in minute . we can do it here then .
don't hear bell . no , not yet . alright , i'll see you in minute . we can do it here then . can we can't we do it here ? just fill that one in . we're doing now .
yes will eraser so . it's fantas fantastic . we can you can save file . so if we draw we have to save everything . don't throw anything away . just we can start new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away . just let them all stand here . we can delete , but we don't do that . you can here select pen , you can draw anything you want . it's bit childish you have to write .
yes our your favourite . so i'm to going to have to draw kangaroo , but i'm going i'm not going to . i'm just going to draw beast what i'm going to design . hope this was part of the assignment and not your hope this was part of the assignment and not your personal enjoyment . said it's not my idea but am the project manager , and officially this is my idea . we're kinda losing time , though . we're losing time , but alright . the first the first meeting is just bit loose , loosen up , bit meeting each other . so start yes . sh hope our industrial designer does this better because this is no so few legs .
it looks amazing . no no no . what are you going to do ? we want to erase it . no no save it and start new save it and start new black doc blank document . these are very impor these are very important documents , , these drawings , and he deliberately draws animal we the english word for . we have to save everything so now the next one and then save it and start an blank document . you go man . there's also different colours and different pen widths the line the the thickness thickness . so you should try it but you could have but .
it looks like an it looks like that beast from sesame street . is it duck ? you're standing in front of it , 't see it . it's it's do we have to but we have do we have to name the specific species of the bird ? is it plane ? it's bird , but what bird ? it doesn't draw circles that easy . you have to push harder . just bit bit childish , bit . release your anger .
it doesn't draw circles that easy . you have to push harder . just bit bit childish , bit . release your anger . it's just bird . save the document and then and then new blank document for . will choose new colour and new pen width so we can all see it . here you go . why do have to do the difficult tasks ? and then you go to format , and current colour you choose new colour .
didn't have to prepare anything about it's not , it's it's not my task to talk about experience with current remote controls , but . just we're four if we if we would just have one then . it's im it's important to look at the remote controls of our competitors . get the good points try to merge them into one universal remote control . on our corporate site saw new d_v_d_ player we're gonna produce . it's important to make it compatible with the d_v_d_ player so you can use your television and your d_v_d_ player with the same remote control . that would be idea , yes . furthermore it's important to make it acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , , because we want to we want to fifty million ? yes fifty million is our aim to profit , so . so lot of people have to be able to use it .
yes fifty million is our aim to profit , so . so lot of people have to be able to use it . no but the the buttons have to have to have international recognisable buttons and and numbers and that every culture in , , people in every country can recognise . easy to learn . i'll make notes and then 'll put it in the project folder when i'm done just now . also think we should not add too many buttons . modern day remotes have too much buttons . you don't use the half of them that's that's culture international . we could make one button to switch between d_v_d_ player and t_v_ and make the other buttons multi-functional . so it doesn't become too complicated with too much buttons and and stereo audio installations .
we also just released t_f_t_ thing saw . so but that's kind standard t_ television so it also works on that . and the people who who will buy our remote already have some experience with remotes . so we can keep that in mind . most people do , . it doesn't it doesn't have to be . it doesn't have to be , but we can . t's it's new remote and you don't buy remote if you don't have anything to to control with it . except if we deliver it together with our d_v_d_ . but we need to to keep it consistent with other but it's it has to be useable .
imagine that us . yes most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get thinner towards the the other end . it fits in your palms . but it's still then the the long box , but then with some round round forms in it to fit your hand , but it's it's still al alright but but it's still it's still box , . it it has it it has that's tha shape that it fits your hand . that's we have five minutes left . it it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what . but it has it has to fit your hand . understand , but no no don't mean an entire box like completely square but also with round edges , but in in in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient round shapes to fit . it shouldn't be too boxy , .
it's common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam . but you can have different between d_v_d_s and televisions and between . and you can use . it it's we we make an universal remote so it ha has to work with all kinds of brands and things . but our t_v_s are mostly made in china and that country , so . and have i've wrote something down about how it works . the user presses button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , but that's pretty obvious , . but are are we going with the front fronts idea ? we can look into that in the in the next thirty minutes . we should make it universal and you can always use front front on it , ?
i've received mail with some additional requirements , and i'll have look if we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really smart to to include some things we can't , because of the new requirements . you're the only one . then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . we have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . and then we can discuss some more closely . we have forty minutes for this discussion ? the closing we'll not look at it yet . now i'll look at show this board . notes , first meeting . gave disc presentation .
the closing we'll not look at it yet . now i'll look at show this board . notes , first meeting . gave disc presentation . we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . so we said that we have to merge the strong points from our competitors , and look at their remote controls . we should make it compatible with our new d_v_d_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . not too many one buttons . one recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . and they can have two functions , because you have d_v_d_ and television .
so if you deliver small click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . no you can click it on your television . but if someone somebody else uses it in ano other room ? in another room , . nee but it it specifically says it's the the control is lost in the same room . so beeping device would be furthermore the learning time is problem . 'll have look at it , . thirty four thirty four per cent thinks it's it's too too difficult to learn . so the the learning curve should be very short for the dumbest people should be able to use it . our user expert should also consider manual manual for the remote , .
in another room , . nee but it it specifically says it's the the control is lost in the same room . so beeping device would be furthermore the learning time is problem . 'll have look at it , . thirty four thirty four per cent thinks it's it's too too difficult to learn . so the the learning curve should be very short for the dumbest people should be able to use it . our user expert should also consider manual manual for the remote , . but people don't read manuals . didn't read it ? users to add one ?
like some little gameboy things or some ? yes i've saw that on on mi mobile telephones they also have those buttons . do people , when they pick up remote , know that they have to do that ? it's it's new feature , you can make make double feature like button on the top and under it . alright , but , but if you say them up and down , they they'll understand it , . it's also if someone puts picks up his remote . eighty per cent would . if someone puts up picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's already on the next channel . he feels it immediately . that's very irritating , .
it's it's new feature , you can make make double feature like button on the top and under it . alright , but , but if you say them up and down , they they'll understand it , . it's also if someone puts picks up his remote . eighty per cent would . if someone puts up picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's already on the next channel . he feels it immediately . that's very irritating , . but in in any case the the basic function should be , and as you say at the thumb . that's good idea , and and that the less important buttons , like the the the different channels , the numbers one two three four five as , should be not in reach , because they don't use it all the time . t's pretty pretty as you said .
then we have still the time , so but we do have to come to decision , later on . losing time losing time . thought everybody on the website would see the same thing , but that's not the case . there are different we have all have different home pages , with different links . you couldn't see this . 'm mike , user interface designer . the the method ? used my own experience with remotes , took good look at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . yes , these are from from another manufacturer . these are already in use ?
this one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and things . this one is user-centred . like user-centr centred also the best . we also do that . that we reduce the the option to control the d_v_d_ also , and teletext and that . so we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . but we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? that's why this is not relevant any more feel . this is about the maximum number of buttons we'll need . kinda like the shape .
for the remote less is more . the less buttons the better the design . we should go with that concept . i've i've got another point . there are two target audi audiences , and we've chose for the younger one . research has shown that it's high interested in features . they are high high interested in feature . but they are more critical . fo , critical . so the younger audience .
the most functions underneath that no usually but most most . clip aren't used much . but because you say they their features are important , they want lot , but not . but what features ? like screens and voice recognition . but i've , that's . here , look at these numbers . the newest features are , like said , are and speech control . our audience , these people , are very like these features . so we must build in something , or they will to go to the concurrent .
so , yes . we we we still need to know how much that will cost . we're no but we're we'll have to look into that . if find that , but next time . or you will get that information . we can use this board again , . we can put some decisions about the controls we want , the issue . where is my presentation ? we're all here now , . understand what you're saying .
we should have general idea of how it's gonna look . these i've already given you . so we have to decide on the different remote control functions . so we want to have small screen that's special . at the top . shouldn't we start with the most important parts ? at the top or at the bottom ? the screen alright but we should start with the power button ? the top is more when you how do you zap ? but but with with the screen on the top it gets bit unnatural .
with the remote ? that thing is terrible . 'cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . but that's where your hand ball might be . mike mike has point , because when when when use remote hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . and then we should centralise the discussion here . we'll draw two , and then we'll see no he thinks , . what you were talking about but we are busy with something . he thinks it's better to put the at the bottom , and it's better at the top . why do you t's better at the bottom ?
for all of us . alright , let's keep it central . we have power button , setting buttons , window , the number buttons yes . the ten numbers ? let's look at your design . the mute button . love that one . we we should use something like this to the the channel up and channel down button ? in circle , ? that's that's also design .
that's that's also design . and and volume control also in it . but on this remote these controls are else , d_v_d_ player . yes , as already said , we could drop some of these buttons . they are for some video apart . so , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . you should put that power button , channel and volume should have the most importance . these should be in one big circle in the middle . but what he said about r_s_i_ was kinda true . when when you put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , and that's just what r_s_i_'s all about .
but but no . not too much . look at look at the frequency . nei not too much , but nei nei nei agree . the other the other two frustrations are far more important . so they are used four times an hour , so power bu button should be left at the top . you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . the power button , you can if someone is constantly zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not beside it . because have someone but the buttons is way . so that one can be put away .
can you make you make we can use the drawing board now , . it it doesn't work but but it it would be pretty pretty if we could just draw simple thing . have it here . that's going to take too too much time . just you decide that , you decide that , and ready . you are industrial , you are user interface . so it's going to go to mike . but you will have to make consensus with . t's bit hard , because we are going to be individually . consensus , we we can put it in the middle , so alright .
it it doesn't work but but it it would be pretty pretty if we could just draw simple thing . have it here . that's going to take too too much time . just you decide that , you decide that , and ready . you are industrial , you are user interface . so it's going to go to mike . but you will have to make consensus with . t's bit hard , because we are going to be individually . consensus , we we can put it in the middle , so alright . we're no we're deciding now , so top or bottom ?
that's bit yes . still t's it's quite important though to to have it at the top , so . yes it is . you say familiarity isn't important but . what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? plus the the design round is still to come ? alright these functions . as we we we we , we do have . the number yes , that's alright . so that's that's enough .
alright these functions . as we we we we , we do have . the number yes , that's alright . so that's that's enough . the number function . are we going to do it like on mike's screen with one button that says i'm going to do two number digital ? how do you want it to do then ? there's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero . just when you push one one and no , if you on most t_v_s if you press two numbers shortly after each other , it . it it has to recognise one as there could still come more .
these are the the most important functions . do you still have the pictures over there ? so no , we'd just said we didn't because we can't integrate it with any other remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are irrelevant . that's about it . you do need the multi or did no , like this one . you do need them ? but are we alright , alright now . so just for television is we need ? it's most useable this way . teletext is gone .
so no , we'd just said we didn't because we can't integrate it with any other remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are irrelevant . that's about it . you do need the multi or did no , like this one . you do need them ? but are we alright , alright now . so just for television is we need ? it's most useable this way . teletext is gone . so all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext screen placing . we'll have those buttons about and the two important ones we're forgetting .
it's most useable this way . teletext is gone . so all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext screen placing . we'll have those buttons about and the two important ones we're forgetting . you can make it wider and less wide . and the button that you can go to a_v_ for your video . do think we have to put that underneath clip . but it's just two , and we make clip ? just two just two under under but you you can put two or three buttons under another section . that's bit waste .
or at the top , . what do you think those those buttons ? above or down ? design it later . we have it , and we design later where everything goes . any other go to video , that's always on your remote control . you you take those if you , but you can you can zap you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to , but when you zap down zero you get to a_v_ . why go to video ? to a_v_ to a_v_ a_v_ a_v_ . the the video channel ?
that's just zero . no not at not at my remote . no no not always . ze zero is different channel than the the video channel . but you can can zap down yes , no , then you press ninety nine . go to ninety-nine . go to video is an irrelevant button , but you must have . that's the button no . but it's easy to go if you are at at channel fifty five and you want to go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push to to get below zero . no you can ch push zero .
you you have one one button from set frequency , and then with plus and min minus you can adjust the , alright . that's the only one we put in there . for screen fu channel setting . to to configure the programme the . you always have in the centre an button , for your menu . and and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast . channel , setting , menu . we have to go . the menu menu button is also important . then you can where ?
this is this is your thing . get into my belly . see you later mate .
suggested in the previous meeting hard plastic . but as you indicated it should be strong . we should change that . it should feel strong . so plastic is not sufficient . we should move to something . it it it is , but it doesn't look strong . so but we still have to look at our price . hard plastic is pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have really really tough look . no no no .
we keep coming back to the fronts . these are the basic older older peoples' . it was not very interesting , very classical looking , but that's that's not what we want . we have these things . what exactly they are . it looks like you recognise the shapes , it's very primary colours , bright colours and round shapes . you also see this device , it's not very round and fruity . it that's true . and round shapes , primary colours . you can see it all here .
the the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . so , if you ti you you you should have some some coloured titanium . and it it doesn't have to be strong , also . nah the feel . only the feel . so it it looks pretty but it feels strong . and then have some more findings . about the energy energy source of the of the device , suggest the basic battery . got some other energy sources . but solar energy is not very practical inside house , because you don't have have lot of sun .
now this to give it more modern look . and now the the shape , , curved case . more modern look not plain , long box style , but i'll draw it , but later . it it mean , . and it makes it gives it more user friendly shape , than if you have . anyway as for the buttons , simple push buttons . no otherwi no difficult scroll things or some things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . and , as we , we don't use speaker or sensor or speak speech controlled device . because it makes it also more complex and expensive . but we do use an screen , so we we do have to consider of we have to use more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive .
young people and every user would like that . the buttons should be positioned positioned the same way as they are on , , conventional remote , . for the learnability and to keep it recognisable . voice recognition can be implemented . and drew an example , but it did not work quite the the way wanted it to do . can you draw it now of can you draw it now ? how how how do you give input to the menu on the screen ? have the draw it again , and did wrong . didn't tick the note bo box in the . with the the up and down and and buttons and the will draw what had drawn on the screen .
have the draw it again , and did wrong . didn't tick the note bo box in the . with the the up and down and and buttons and the will draw what had drawn on the screen . so you have menu button , and then you can go up and down . but then we should also have an an button . shall draw this . if it works . just there is already blank . you have to push hard . suggest banana shape .
just the numbers . and then below is the screen ? these these will be bigger in the the real design . this must be the button used to interact with the screen . and with this you can , yes , go to through the menus and that can the video button should be an apart button , because you want it to , , to use it fast within one click . and what's the menu button ? and you you need you need speaker . this button can also be the menu button , we use in the menus we can add another button here , but . but how did how do you get out of the menu then ? you could just do an an exit with .
nah it's too expensive . ha , even more . this is what we've just done . but are we going for strange form ? no , not very strange . 'cause people like that . not not too strange . not too strange . you can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the is . it still has yes .
no , not very strange . 'cause people like that . not not too strange . not too strange . you can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the is . it still has yes . so it falls over the hand . if the no nokia telephone , with the round thing at at the bottoms , something like that . have at home remote with bridge . it's just half round half half circle at and then it falls exactly over the hand , and that's very .
we why don't we use titanium or or hard , , some metal for the the the whole remote except the front . do the new no no the front is the most important . that just like most cell phones are . so we have titanium . but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that strong look . and then the front is made of plastic . and you can put that on and off , and switch it . but the feel of plastic isn't strong . no but you have titanium . no but you you have this .
i've titanium back , plastic front . am going to put it in here , because we can look . solid feel and trendy look . so material , hard plastic for the front ? for the front and then titanium for the back . for the non-removable part . but then you have the problem , when you have titanium back , you can't switch it . when you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . but the titan titanium isn't isn't very , it doesn't curves . titanium is neutral .
inside , but this is for the coffee machine . but that's not what's meant here , . coffee grind doesn't have na ja . never mind the coffee grind . all the all the inside work of our remote is standard work . so the chip is normal silicon . the buttons are normal , etcetera . so that's just easy . we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier remotes . the conceptual specification of the user interface ?
not not very sim not . not too heavy . you can always take another pick . we should not give them the the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time . they have to buy it later on . we still have to make those fifty million , ? very boring , . you can you can give them three or so , so that they can experiment with it and that they want more . the most boring fronts possible . the most ugly .
very boring , . you can you can give them three or so , so that they can experiment with it and that they want more . the most boring fronts possible . the most ugly . but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them , and and and we still have to make we have still have to make the es the the real basic design . red red , blue and green you give them , and then you can give them other ones . the buttons etcetera , we get from mike . this fruit and bright colours , we'll have to in the next half an hour , we'll have to specify the different types we want to launch , when we ntroduce our remote . because we have the sketch but alright , . but we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing .
where is my mouse ? this is it . this we have . interface we have . cheap voice recording . we should do that . we all agree on that . industry designer , . user interface , mike . you're going to work together on prototype drawing on the smartboard .
to make it as as round as possible . and these these these buttons are more triangle-ish shaped with square one in the middle . why does fuck you . so you can see you have to up or down . but now see the that depends . and this must be volume , and this programme . most of the time up and down is programme and left and are volume , . we can't get ts it doesn't work any more . it depends , but if you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up . we we we'll just give them an we'll design it , and then they can give comments on it .
t's quite long phrase . we put the fashion in electronics . but we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts . you but you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . the logo and the and the they do . the logo should be on the top . on the top . in in the top corner ? corner , yes . and you on the back , you can put at the bottom , you can put the logo with the .
corner , yes . and you on the back , you can put at the bottom , you can put the logo with the . corner , or here in the middle ? but the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . just just small . at the back ? it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front . carved into the material . you can the logo can be on on every front . but you can scratch it off .
but the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . just just small . at the back ? it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front . carved into the material . you can the logo can be on on every front . but you can scratch it off . it's better if you have it . but then you must really push it in . no , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back .
it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front . carved into the material . you can the logo can be on on every front . but you can scratch it off . it's better if you have it . but then you must really push it in . no , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back . like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing . but am the only one , or no not on the front , but on the backside . on the backside .
but we'll we'll take that with us into the design . over here the logo . or here in the middle , but we'll decide later . when changing fronts . alright , that's decided . do you do you see bit of the of the of the titanium ? five minutes left . on the front ? if we make this this this lower part titanium , the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the screen . yes we could no , they have two fronts , that .
five minutes left . on the front ? if we make this this this lower part titanium , the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the screen . yes we could no , they have two fronts , that . so bit of titanium between ? no no betwe of between we can do but but then you have two parts of front , two fronts that this enti entire bottom ? that's bit that that's that's pretty . no no no no . you have to make this titanium too . you you can .
that's bit that that's that's pretty . no no no no . you have to make this titanium too . you you can . else you you get problems with the . like dust in it and so things like that . when you exchange all the fronts and it's open . already have all kinds of filth between the mobile . no , you can you can just and then not straight line but some wave . and then the lower part is titanium ?
this is titanium . and this is front . some some wei weight in it . like that bit of titanium also on the bit like bit like your mobile phone . with the with the curved edge . you can show it . it also has the those two distinct bit like this . you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is . because it has to be there all the time . so round where ?
i'm going to buy it . we want it . this is the front . and it's only twenty five euros . this is the my design . that's bit too much , but no , no no no , but this looks pretty actually . no that's nothing . the phillips remote costs more . because it's my design but no our our design , alright . taking all the credit .
but there's problem . we can't take blank one . or can we ? can erase an animal . the fourth one . nah that's alright , that's alright . but don't erase my cat . the fourth one is empty , isn't it ? want to preserve it . this one is empty .
want to preserve it . this one is empty . you have to empty one ? what are you doing chief ? so , you can draw . we have to ? 'll get i'll get the message . until the until the beep goes . but don't do we have to stay here , or we have to return first . no , you'll you can keep your laptop here .
so , you can draw . we have to ? 'll get i'll get the message . until the until the beep goes . but don't do we have to stay here , or we have to return first . no , you'll you can keep your laptop here . or get your mouse . because it's little bit hard to work with these plates . the high powers from above will have to tell us , . it's not relaxing .
from me , . you had some very strange layout . from us all , , from all of us . it's chorus , . we ge we went through the agenda , and had some some presentations from you three . and summarised what you said to us . so don't t's very interesting and go through it again . so this is what we decided . it's also copy paste from what we made together . so we still know that .
with arrow shapes , which makes it also bit more exciting than basic round or square buttons . and also here are the two buttons we on . we have the button . nei we the button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and volume changers . and then we've here the menu button and the and the video button . menu for the screen . and this low part , this is the screen . this is what we made of it . you can make suggestions if you want . look at it , the side the side view .
no the back . with the logo and our no don't think and the and about the side view this the front won't be as thick , but again the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really , it won't be visible . we thought about , the back is titanium . and we thought about the logo big in the middle . just so again the double . we have then the logo on front and on the back . that's too much but you have to say say that if you think that way . and the company slogan , we thought in arc shape above the logo . that's what we were thinking about , and and before forget . see , but .
they the the the the the side view , we didn't . we we he drew the the side , but you you weren't paying attention as usual . any case , we'll discuss it now . this is pretty good good idea . agree with the screen . you have it in your palm like this , and you can watch watch the screen . and if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . but you you hold it like this . you you don't you don't grab it , you you . you're not holding it like this .
no , it's . but what about the redesigning ? comes to that later . you can walter . you're very personal again . you can do the evaluation criteria on this ? that's more useful than just speaking . this is just short intro . i'm going to do the ev evaluation . that's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .
comes to that later . you can walter . you're very personal again . you can do the evaluation criteria on this ? that's more useful than just speaking . this is just short intro . i'm going to do the ev evaluation . that's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . so made made few questions on the hand of the impor most important requirements and trends . and we have to look if our if our device is working correctly .
it let's start with the beginning , just one by one . we designed it to be good-looking , so . so but we have to be critic critical about it . and have to take all these points and get average at the end . so we we know where we stand . 'cause there are some things we might have bi might have forgotten . so it's point four . easy to find two . is it good-looking ? it's it's it's pointed towards the youth , if you look at the design and and the colours and everything .
so the last one is seven . easy to change channels ? no it's with two huge buttons . no , not false . have to go through it . it's as easy as can be made . you how can you make it any easier ? the power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? the device is easy to find if you lose it ? we we don't we don't have that .
no it's with two huge buttons . no , not false . have to go through it . it's as easy as can be made . you how can you make it any easier ? the power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? the device is easy to find if you lose it ? we we don't we don't have that . we didn't implement anything about that . t's easier to find than normal black one , because of the colour .
the power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? the device is easy to find if you lose it ? we we don't we don't have that . we didn't implement anything about that . t's easier to find than normal black one , because of the colour . but we have so few functions , so . don't have the device that beeps when you lost it or so , but . are the functions easy to learn ? we do want we have less of an and the device r_s_i_ sensitive ? should two , because the voice recorder is not self learning .
we we don't we don't have that . we didn't implement anything about that . t's easier to find than normal black one , because of the colour . but we have so few functions , so . don't have the device that beeps when you lost it or so , but . are the functions easy to learn ? we do want we have less of an and the device r_s_i_ sensitive ? should two , because the voice recorder is not self learning . but just do some we we this is too time consuming . are we take too much time ?
should two , because the voice recorder is not self learning . but just do some we we this is too time consuming . are we take too much time ? not not towards you , but towards this all . this is we you have to put it to the customers . ll bit , so four . and features included also one . those nine is the fancy-looking . device fancy feeling . and fancy-feeling too , because of the titanium back .
the two two . yes we have not many buttons . so two because of the voice recorder . with the three . two , three . are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? our covers , in our fronts . so yes , one . one or two . is the material attractive ?
one or two , another two . if you look at this no . it doesn't really resemble any fruit , that's true . but but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours . three , alright . and you can also have front with with fruit on it . is the material attractive ? the titanium is strong , and the rest the buttons feel soft . so would say at least two . this is the last meeting ?
but but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours . three , alright . and you can also have front with with fruit on it . is the material attractive ? the titanium is strong , and the rest the buttons feel soft . so would say at least two . this is the last meeting ? yes , but we we have to design much more , because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . the average will come later . knew things were going too smoothly .
yes , but we we have to design much more , because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . the average will come later . knew things were going too smoothly . there had to be some trouble along the way . look at the costs at this point . had to fit it in . it has to go to twelve , ? twelve and half . twelve and half . so what costs lot ?
the sample spea costs four . the tha that's that's bit an optional option . the sample speaker , the sensor . kick it out . kick it out . we have to go to twelve and half . the speaker costs far , by far the most . that's some wrong info , man . it it isn't worth it . no , no .
have bit of problem . because the screen . be for the you had said . can't we do that with regular chip ? because that because my information says it . what what's the difference between simple and regular ? what's the difference between simple and regular chip ? regular is normal . read something about it , but , read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . didn't in include it in my report .
regular is normal . read something about it , but , read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . didn't in include it in my report . what happens if we do how much do we win ? single you have to use chip . so you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the screen . we we we why ? we have very little options furthermore , for the have to put that in . but if you have regular chip , you can't have the screen . we need to have the the screen .
yes , that's curved . this is actually two curves , . it's how you it's how you look at it . no , it's one curve . one curve , simple . then we have huge problem . we can never get below the twelve and half . we have big financial problem . make it more expensive to buy . then we have two dollars less profit .
so we have to use the ditch the titanium , i'm afraid . no because we did not know anything about it . what do we what do we know ? all we want is is fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . yes , yes . so al alright , . one and half euros . but we have to deal with it now . so if you don't have the money , you can't make it . so so titanium gone and add plastic .
no it's just all plastic . no no six . lot of plastic , . it's just free , man . so but then we can add the special colour ? no two for the to make it clear . as we have money over left . and we still have money left . the case is double curved then . what do we want , ?
no two for the to make it clear . as we have money over left . and we still have money left . the case is double curved then . what do we want , ? want gold plating . no no we have we have to fill we ha no no no , but that's not you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . because you have that curve and you have that curve . we have curves in all directions . that that is the problem .
it was complete disaster . no it it it it is no it's other way around . don't like it . t's also it's both the smartboards . no , that's smartboard , and that's digital pen . that's the smartboard . that's the digital panel . liked this smartboard , but hated that one . this this this isn't smartboard , ? t's both smartboard .
but that one . that one isn't accurate . it just doesn't work . you can , but there's big distinction between the these don't need smartboard . but this is meant by the digital pen . that is so . didn't use nei it it's much but you can sent it about three times now . we're now talking about the smartboards . we used that one , and we needed it . but give me beamer .
it's , no , it it's useless . and made mistake . but it it would have been useful , if could show this on the screen . for drawings , yes . for drawings , but not for personal notes . that's not very you can bring your paperwork along and if you have lot of paper if you've if you've understand . but but for notes , it you you have to put that in strict you have to put name , standard date , and all those things . it might be useful for drawings . agree on that . and notes for meeting are very strict .
for drawings , yes . for drawings , but not for personal notes . that's not very you can bring your paperwork along and if you have lot of paper if you've if you've understand . but but for notes , it you you have to put that in strict you have to put name , standard date , and all those things . it might be useful for drawings . agree on that . and notes for meeting are very strict . so if you were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to word . so it doesn't doesn't have any . that stefan use .
half of time didn't notice they were there . haven't looked one time directly at the camera . so but we shouldn't talk about that . don't care about it . because this is realistic environment . etcetera we new ideas found ? what ideas for future schedule what ? for future meetings you have got ? missed the option to to email , . communicate in between .
for future meetings you have got ? missed the option to to email , . communicate in between . email or chat . chatting and emailing . that's just the the environment they set us up with . so , for drawing for drawings . but that's one new idea . new ideas found by this . more more information in the beginning .
hated to draw like that . you you can't draw anything neat . but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , , very precise , mu it saves time . anything you want . if it if it would be perfect following . then still it's it's it's very expensive towards just green school board . isn't , but that thing is is , board , school board , . but but then you can save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and . it has it is useful . this if it works correct , this thing this thing is just malfunctioning .
have to do that . you better get started . di did you save this one in the folder ? can you do that ? no no no no . no we must save this thing , . in the shared map map . but nils you've got some work left . what you have to do . map , is it good word ?
can you do that ? no no no no . no we must save this thing , . in the shared map map . but nils you've got some work left . what you have to do . map , is it good word ? the folder , . have to go to physiotherapy . two times quick .
is it is it is duck . so now save ? blank , yes . let's try this . i'm not getting anything on my screen now . he did it before . no , no . so you can always go back . so that's it . so that was two .
what what does it have to have ? not not too heavy . not too heavy . not much buttons . that when you drop it , it won't break . like some rubber on it . or hard hard plastic . buttons not too small . something like when you lose your remote control , sometimes it happen . it between the couch and you can't find it .
nah , nah , nah . that's the empty one . and presentation of working design . here it is . little later but here it is . so now have ten minutes to tell it . it's little difficult what i'm gonna tell you . it's about the working of the remote control . had an half an hour to study it and don't get it . ten minutes to tell it .
or is it also for other company for other televisions ? we have to use it also on other televisions though . then this is an option . so but don't it they are two different things though . just menu button to use it on our televisions . and then we make it easier for our televisions . and on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the ? we have to choose one . it has to work on all televisions . then the menu button will only work on the newer televisions .
we have to choose one . it has to work on all televisions . then the menu button will only work on the newer televisions . and we will look forward and don't make remote control which for the older televisions . and have one more idea . it's one of your tasks . but , to have trendy remote control , we can also make something like the nokia mobile phones . to change covers . so if you have trendy half with all red , yellow and something . and then you can put red cover on it .
then it won't be will have just one cover on the original one . and then you can buy the covers . yes but you have to be able to change it . does it make it more difficult to design ? it will be little more difficult , but not too much . just like with the nokia mobile phones . but there are much more nokia telephones than these ones . but then we'll have to to just put five covers on it , and see if it works . if it won't works then we'll get something else . then we won't go further with it .
but trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and the the children think , this is my remote control , made picture on it . but that too less people would change it for good profit . so yes it is but don't think we have to do it . and the other people ? what do you think about it ? it's good idea . but if if it , don't i'm not if it will make profit enough to but it's it's original idea . you're the project manager . so now the user interface designer . yes shall give short talk about the the technical function design .
basic or multifunctional ? we'll got back on that later . the that was just on my mind . so didn't what way we would go . that was my functional talk . then it's your turn , the marketing expert . this bit too far . so so i'm gonna have presentation about the market , about what people think . we did usability lab-test with hundred persons . and we looked at several things .
yes the newer televisions ha do have menus . it will be quite easy to use , to have four arrows . the only one or two numbers . that's ch yes . up-down for channel selection , and left-right for volume . and menu button . and if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . but the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . on the screen , you mean ? that depends on if you have the menu on the t_v_ .
that depends on if you have the menu on the t_v_ . or you get the menu on the screen on the remote control . t's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . so we need yes . but then we come to the costs . but if we have this so now we don't have lot of buttons . but you aim at the younger market , as they as as we seen in the usability lab , they will buy looking remote control . and also to find the easy to use part very important . so if we have sh screen , and not too many buttons , that will incre even when it's bit more cost , it will still sell . is this enough ?
no that's for the next phase . phase two is the conceptual design . so then we'll have the concepts . that's for the so next point . now we have lunch-break . after that we have thirty minutes for work . and you can find the minutes in the project documents folder inclusive the buttons . your individual action , you can find them in the email . so now it's time for lunch .
i'm next , . here we go . at first we will will say something about what younger people want , our group we want to sell our remote controls to . and then , i'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about what battery is in it , what buttons also . first , the younger people , they want like soft mat materials and primary colours . like , yellow , red . so it's visible . the shapes are curved and round , like you also said . it's to get remote control not like all the other ones , straight and flat and long . but to give him the shape of your hand , so you it's easier to use like that .
the main thing is we look at the costs . and not too basic , not basic remote control , who everybody already has . but , thi this is with an ? no , not . not with an . no , isn't . but the is easy when you use the scroll buttons . then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push . but then , what say , the costs will get lot higher . but then it's not easy to use scroll wheel .
got it on my screen and it was higher . but how much higher . 'cause it if we have an , it will also sell lot better . and that might bring back the costs . but then we'll we must discuss who what will be better . if we have better shape of the remote control , or better options on it . with scroll menu , scroll thing , and . and then flat remote control . or , more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without . you can look how how much it is for the .
that's from my manufacturing division . so , my presentation is about trend-watching . did some trend-watching . it's very important to keep up with latest trends . 'cause if you don't , you won't sell . so , how we did do that ? made an investigation of the market , by trendwatchers . they watch in cities like paris and milan . known for their trend trends . and , what did you find ?
or shapes or what do we need ? can make several concepts . we have this , and we had the idea of an more like sh in the shape of your hand . and you have to . i'm not designer . it's more three d_ . like , when you have part here . this is the remote control . and then you have something like this under it . so , it's easier to get it like this .
can make several concepts . we have this , and we had the idea of an more like sh in the shape of your hand . and you have to . i'm not designer . it's more three d_ . like , when you have part here . this is the remote control . and then you have something like this under it . so , it's easier to get it like this . it's like gun .
and it has to be soft , . so , you can squeeze in it and ? and , the buttons ? buttons on top of it . you can do it with your thumb . but but that's the only scroll button on it then ? but now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . no , it won't . one till zero till nine . but , there one for the sound and one for the channels .
buttons on top of it . you can do it with your thumb . but but that's the only scroll button on it then ? but now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . no , it won't . one till zero till nine . but , there one for the sound and one for the channels . but but how . or two buttons . and if we go to but if we have me .
and then you also can scroll scroll in it . just not like all the other ones , with this thing , and here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . because , from hundred remote controls , ninety nine have it . then we have it on the t_v_ , the menu . but again how do we know the t_v_ can handle it ? so , there's no menu . it's like some teletext option , but we don't have teletext . so you can't use it . and if we put an thing on it , then the costs will be much higher . we make two concepts .
so , there's no menu . it's like some teletext option , but we don't have teletext . so you can't use it . and if we put an thing on it , then the costs will be much higher . we make two concepts . but you all like this thing . with the scroll button . but that's one . and and this one has to be soft . and this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst .
one with two scroll buttons and one with without . one with with menu , and one without menu . and the one with with menu has an . do have to do everything . you have not so difficult . but if you put push the the menu button , wh what yes , but you which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . that's the menu . there for the screen . you have to for the menu . one that way .
when you the menu , you have to go there there there there . they were like round curves , different , , . that's that's the outside . but now the first the buttons . think we have we have now two buttons missing . the the mute button . we have two buttons missing . the mute button . and , the to to have to numbers . and the other .
or small one just like in laptop . like in laptop , some thing . little bit bigger , with easier thi . mean , it's better . but how expensive it is ? why do pay you for ? or no scroll things . and no , no . for the young peoples scroll button's good . it won't work .
then it's not so big . no , no , no . the the shape of the remote control . the sh , but then you can you have to use with one hand . just like playstation thing . so , if it's possible , it's not too expensive , joystick is better . so , look at it . no , that's , got they're not in details . and on the , how much it costs ? it costs extra ?
we you get it . so , after this meeting you have half an hour to fix it . then have to come with it . got my personal costs . don't the costs . then i'll make something up . so , do we have other concepts ? then for the components , we use normal battery . then it's ch cheapest way , . or the or the kinetic with normal battery .
no , no kinetic . it's , , more expensive . kinetic is ch makes it more expensive . so we use normal battery . depends on the . depends on the scroll . if we use scroll , then we have the regular chip . if we don't use scroll , then we can use the simple chip . and that's the most expensive . and , we if you use the , we have to yes , .
and then just put also on on it ? if you have pistol , it l_c_d_'s not easy . but if you use phone . just use your thumb . use my thumb . but but then you have it . like , if you have pistol , you have it so . and the screen is , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen . if you have joystick on no , if you have like an ni playstation game controller . and you move up , forward , down , left .
and everything is blue , except the power button . and the mute . of , and the mute and the the other button . channel higher channel button . and the joystick is for the volume and the channels . yes , that's very obvious . up is channel up . down is channel down . to the is volume up . to the left is volume down .
or are we going to ev evaluate it first ? finance is it's no , first yes . we have to evaluate the product yet . that's that can be none . we gonna do the evaluation now , together . but have introduction how it works . so , it will come up . we , have thinked few evaluation criterias , based on our marketing strategy , on the latest trends , on user preferences . we have seven point scale from true , as . to false , seven ?
so , this not very important . but , if get number in here . no , it's . we can't do that . i'll get it . so you have to think of it as the remote control is techno technologically innovative . and then we have to agree on the rating together . and in the end , we will count an average of all rating . the first on each item . what do you think ?
just small thing . no , we did not . so , but can it get lost if it's such thing ? looks like pistol . not not normal shapes . it won't get between the pillows on the couch . it won't get lost . aimed for the younger market . did we achieve that . with the way it looks and it is designed , will give it two .
looks like pistol . not not normal shapes . it won't get between the pillows on the couch . it won't get lost . aimed for the younger market . did we achieve that . with the way it looks and it is designed , will give it two . me that was our target . there's fancy look-and-feel . that that was , , one of the most important things that trendwatch said .
so , now we have product . but , is it cheap enough ? so if i'll have look . we have battery . cheapest there is . it's the most advanced . we have that one . it's the most advanced . we have the simple , regular and advanced . we have the adva advanced .
so if i'll have look . we have battery . cheapest there is . it's the most advanced . we have that one . it's the most advanced . we have the simple , regular and advanced . we have the adva advanced . so uncurved or flat . single curved or double curved ?
i've for remote control , it is . if we would have normal buttons instead of the joystick . for up down left . then we lose two euros . then we have thirteen euros . half euro too much . exactly the special colours . and what if we use only one just only plastic or only rubber ? so that's one euro . one euro discount .
then you have or you have to cut this off . then it's not good anymore . i'll have look . we yellow rubber . and if you say it's just normal colour it's normal colour , wh no one will see it . normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , , left . one minute , . and it's twelve euros , . is it maximum . it's normal colour .
no , no , no . or it's then regular ? the advanced chip was for the wasn't it ? so , the advanced is for the and the regular for the joystick . and what if we lose the ? if we lose the , then we have an regular chip and no . but is it good design ? then you'll have to see the menu on the television . and you don't have the . if if we have the no buttons if we have we have not joystick but buttons , we would have , we have thirteen euros ?
the advanced chip was for the wasn't it ? so , the advanced is for the and the regular for the joystick . and what if we lose the ? if we lose the , then we have an regular chip and no . but is it good design ? then you'll have to see the menu on the television . and you don't have the . if if we have the no buttons if we have we have not joystick but buttons , we would have , we have thirteen euros ? so , the t_v_s has to have to be up-to-date . and then we move the the colour .
so , the advanced is for the and the regular for the joystick . and what if we lose the ? if we lose the , then we have an regular chip and no . but is it good design ? then you'll have to see the menu on the television . and you don't have the . if if we have the no buttons if we have we have not joystick but buttons , we would have , we have thirteen euros ? so , the t_v_s has to have to be up-to-date . and then we move the the colour . what will that be ?
then you'll have to see the menu on the television . and you don't have the . if if we have the no buttons if we have we have not joystick but buttons , we would have , we have thirteen euros ? so , the t_v_s has to have to be up-to-date . and then we move the the colour . what will that be ? no knew that . so no joystick . no , but we then we get push-buttons from half euro . then it's twelve euro fifty , then it's .
so , the t_v_s has to have to be up-to-date . and then we move the the colour . what will that be ? no knew that . so no joystick . no , but we then we get push-buttons from half euro . then it's twelve euro fifty , then it's . yes , yes , yes , yes . no special colour . twelve and half euros .
so and where's ? so , now it's . and the joystick away . and its buttons . but then it will be just that ones . now it's very good . still , he waited at the no . now , project eva evaluation . what do you think of it ? about the project .
are you ready ? you should put the laptop into the square . for the cameras alright . for for the cameras , yes . good morning , sebastian . good morning , mister p_m_ . how are you today ? how was your business trip to boston ? actually didn't go , didn't feel like it . so do you want to open it as read-only .
how was your business trip to boston ? actually didn't go , didn't feel like it . so do you want to open it as read-only . should close it here . you have the same message of windows cannot sen stand-by . close the the window . the waiting is for our marketing expert , ruud . is there schedule for this meeting ? yes , there is actually . will li list the agenda for today .
yes , there is actually . will li list the agenda for today . for this meeting . good morning , ruud . it's important , . shall close the door . it's important that the laptops are exactly on the square , for the cameras . we're here to develop new product . i'm you've had mail from our account manager about it . and this is the first meeting to to generate some some ideas about it .
during the discussion section ? this new product we are are are going to develop , it's remote control , television remote control . and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . those are easy goals , and i'm we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . we will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those things . the market , we should have look at the market . we are going to use pred project method during this development , which consists of three different design stages . the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , all of these stages mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then meet to discuss our the the the progressions , yes . the first stage , the functional design we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will make specific specification of that . the second is the technical functional design , what effect should the remote have ?
this case control the the television . it's for the vision . and the last one is the working design . how exactly does it work in the technical sense . the other design stages , we will discuss that later . so we'll kop it keep it with the functional design . before we think about remote control we will work with some of the tools we have here . as you see now give presentation . it's also possible to use this one as . you can display pr two presentations if you want to .
in the meetings , only in the meetings . it's really like like regu regular whiteboard . you can choose the format , . let me see . it's because i'm not pen selected . current colour , you can choose another colour . and black , and you choose the line width . so now have different line width and colour . quite easy , if you do have any questions , just ask me . to , i'm wrote down the documents should be in the project documents folder if you want to discuss it with us .
but , flores . but different animal with different colour and different line width . sebastian is thinking about the animal . i'm just guessing what should be my favourite animal . i'm think about it too . it looked more than bunny than cat , but it works , ? it it should be cat . i'll give it try . i'm guessing horse . with very small legs .
it it should be cat . i'll give it try . i'm guessing horse . with very small legs . was very good in drawing . you should feed that that animal . you get the idea . so you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . any questions , just just let me know . back to our project .
there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . it could come in handy . we should discuss that . and we should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other . we're not living in the nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not is not really hot technical anymore . but you should think about the things like bluetooth . but , but the infrared , it's , , little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . but it's cost-effective . but all the t_v_s are equipped with infrared , so you you can most of them . not all , not all .
had few things in mind . the interoperability , just like sebastian said , the remote should work on different t_v_s or even different , what is it , devices ? so it's universal remote control for customers to buy just new in store . yes , it should be something like that . it's not for for for philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , ? so we're we're going business to consumer , not we're we're it's not no . it's no have don't have the information for it . we're not developing this product for specific vendor , are we ? no , we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to very broad public , so it should fit to every device . ruud , do you agree ?
so it's universal remote control for customers to buy just new in store . yes , it should be something like that . it's not for for for philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , ? so we're we're going business to consumer , not we're we're it's not no . it's no have don't have the information for it . we're not developing this product for specific vendor , are we ? no , we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to very broad public , so it should fit to every device . ruud , do you agree ? the techni fu technical function what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the t_v_ . that's just the basic technical function .
or what we should take in account when developing such product ? most most things have already been said , like control multiple devices . and , , infrared might be an issue . he said about abo what he said about pointing . but lots of devices already use infrared . so we'll probably have to implement that . sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? yes , remember . you said something about visibility in the dark . would it be for user to have display on this remote control , on which you can see functions ?
yes , remember . you said something about visibility in the dark . would it be for user to have display on this remote control , on which you can see functions ? which makes it easier to operate it . but it it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with black mark on it . the the the digits in black . then it's already visible in dark . so it it don't have to be lightning or or fancy , it can be for design , . , , because because we wa we want to develop trendy product . yes , but there's cost limitation too .

opened the c_d_ rom box . can get cup of coffee ? you can't , . so just cancel it . during my work have no time either . so so too . this is life . opened the c_d_ rom box . but it's alright . people , welcome back with the second meeting .
can get cup of coffee ? you can't , . so just cancel it . during my work have no time either . so so too . this is life . opened the c_d_ rom box . but it's alright . people , welcome back with the second meeting . for now on the schedule are few points .
how can geez , and sli and show . just press it . we we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous discussion . the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is to send messages to the television set . so that was the main important thing what remote control should do . then found two different remote controls , the multi-function remote control with many possibilities , but the lack of the feeling already mentioned in the previous discussion . and the ease-of-use remote control with the less possibilities but feeling in in touching the buttons . my personal preferences were ease of the easy to use remote control , because the user-friendliness and it can be more trendy in in user design . but your new goal was for people than less than forty years old . so the multi-function can be implemented in in our design .
, we will we all . just for for user desi user friendliness should choose for the the ease of use remote control . it's still the thing . there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . all this device has to do is send messages to t_v_ set . and the most easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to t_v_ set . tried to implement picture here , but it's hardly readable . can you see it ? no , it's not visible . there's energy source here .
no , they're power friendly leds also . so we can use them . so that's no problem . for the same costs , it's can be in our combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's . no , they're they're little bit more expensive , but by making we can we can make its . you could only lit the buttons the buttons that are used most . so , the channel switching . or , true . but but the question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such difference in the costs if you already plan to include fancy lightning techniques , . but , it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , and not for , but not for each button one led , .
that's bit of that's problem . another device is not solution . like clapping in your hands , like turning on and off the the the lights . it should be , but you'll get some new technologies for it . there there are some devices who incorporate this technique already . there are video sets and they have special button , the find the remote control button . you press it and your t_v_ set starts to make weird sound , and your remote controls then start to beep . reports rep respend response to it . just like the phones the but but t_v_s don't have all buttons . yes , that's it .
was more thinking about more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks like that . if if it's user-friendly . that's your field of expertise . because we do not implement user history . there's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that the system . know , but but if we use like stick , , . we can use light for that . when you move the stick to to position , light next to it can lit up . so i've just pushed the button , or changed the channel or turned up the volume . something like that .
which incorporates all function available on the device ? do not want full it's not necessary to to have full list , but want the functions , the most important are volume and programme selecting . the ten digits . , that that's what we should think about . how is the remote going to look ? and just one function . not not in the user interface , but . the the the the programme to programme button , the switch to two channels , when you have something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can change . bit of split mode . yes , yes .
and just one function . not not in the user interface , but . the the the the programme to programme button , the switch to two channels , when you have something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can change . bit of split mode . yes , yes . dual channel watch . should write that down . you're the secretary . ruud , what's your last name ? mielsen , because was writing it down in the last mielsen .
yes , that's important . are are you ? if you want to go to channel ninety and you have that button . i'm not so . that's complicated , but is that so relevant ? because don't think but you should shou you should know that . wouldn't buy it personally . if it were so . remote control without the ten digits . imagine when imagine when you're when you have satellite decoder and and you have , , about six hundred channels , imagine you want this .
i'm not so . that's complicated , but is that so relevant ? because don't think but you should shou you should know that . wouldn't buy it personally . if it were so . remote control without the ten digits . imagine when imagine when you're when you have satellite decoder and and you have , , about six hundred channels , imagine you want this . and the most just elder elder people would would buy it , but . but , and if if we and if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . but if you're regular t_v_ user , and you just want to watch the the dutch television networks , , you can you can use about ten buttons .
because don't think but you should shou you should know that . wouldn't buy it personally . if it were so . remote control without the ten digits . imagine when imagine when you're when you have satellite decoder and and you have , , about six hundred channels , imagine you want this . and the most just elder elder people would would buy it , but . but , and if if we and if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . but if you're regular t_v_ user , and you just want to watch the the dutch television networks , , you can you can use about ten buttons . but we do have thirteen different dutch channels . the older people only use five of them .
so and and there are some numbers about speech recognition here that younger people would like it . no , you're probably . but these ten buttons look bit dull . don't you think ? it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the you you can make them very fancy by nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . on the design . then there should be should done be done something specific with it . so i'm i'm do not agree exactly , exactly . so you can experiment by with with shape or with size or with colour , that thing . it might be expensive and hard to implement , but it would be solution for .
you have to do nothing for it . and if we if we could inc include cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be big problem . because it seems like very is cradle very cheap ? twelve dollar fifty . i'll have to find that out . so no , that's very cheap . it's , it's very cheap . that's no problem . it's just case with two metal contacts . know , but there should be an adapter as .
twelve dollar fifty . i'll have to find that out . so no , that's very cheap . it's , it's very cheap . that's no problem . it's just case with two metal contacts . know , but there should be an adapter as . it's yes , but they're they're mass production . they're very cheap . so it will cost us practically nothing .
the the board . and this even makes it more cheapy . but the cheaper the ch the the chip or what was it ? the circuit board . the circuit board . the fewer buttons you can use on it . the fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . no , it's . it's the other way around , . and it's very cheap to incorporate an integrated circuit , chip .
the circuit board . the circuit board . the fewer buttons you can use on it . the fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . no , it's . it's the other way around , . and it's very cheap to incorporate an integrated circuit , chip . so that's that's another advantage . it shouldn't be big issue . then we should just take look at the costs and especially for the voice recognition .
no no no , we didn't but it shouldn't be integrated , it's it's user interface , but was talking about really the design of the no . do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting ? we can decide the next meeting . because i'll have some updated info on that adapt . all of you have updated info . i'm the marketing expert will receive you will do some trend watching . and i'm the market will will change , adapt and so we will see that . that's it for now . any other questions or can we have the lunch ? we can have the lunch .
we can decide the next meeting . because i'll have some updated info on that adapt . all of you have updated info . i'm the marketing expert will receive you will do some trend watching . and i'm the market will will change , adapt and so we will see that . that's it for now . any other questions or can we have the lunch ? we can have the lunch . i'll take the lunch .
because otherwise will already open it . unless things have suddenly change again . is it much changes ? you've got new information , like last time . didn't no no . do hot have only the same information . hello , sebastian . hello hello mister p_m_ . believe miss tentel is with us as , in the control room . that's where the thinking goes on .
you've got new information , like last time . didn't no no . do hot have only the same information . hello , sebastian . hello hello mister p_m_ . believe miss tentel is with us as , in the control room . that's where the thinking goes on . it's that roo again , always late . you should punish him . you're the p_m_ .
one example given was this , so assume they just want something colourful . not specifically an apple as remote control . not something dull . but they like dark colours , you said in the . no , the younger group likes more colourful objects . then suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow . but which one ? had or we could make . but can you can you go back to that slide ? the just one slide back , no no no .
but personally wouldn't like sponge as remote control . but soft material . but not real sponge . it it it rubber or or . and like the older group likes familiar materials , but that doesn't mean we should use wood , so , this this is an example of what they would like . but since we're conten concentrating on the younger group , we should use soft materials and make it colourful or like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . so we could provide both for the young and the old what they like . it's quite interesting . you could make few very colourful ones , and very traditional co cover . i'm thinking about the bananarama telephone telephone from siemens .
the just one slide back , no no no . and the feel of the material has to be spongy . has it something to do with that natural feeling also , do you think ? but personally wouldn't like sponge as remote control . but soft material . but not real sponge . it it it rubber or or . and like the older group likes familiar materials , but that doesn't mean we should use wood , so , this this is an example of what they would like . but since we're conten concentrating on the younger group , we should use soft materials and make it colourful or like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . so we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .
we have the simple design . the phone , but imagine it . it's the siemens c_ twenty five , believe it's it's the one the post-bank gave away , the very you kn , ruud , as ? that one , yes . and the the light blue and it's also in yellow . now kn , know , know . yes , i've seen it . i've seen it . i've seen it , but . do you have thit that was .
that one , yes . and the the light blue and it's also in yellow . now kn , know , know . yes , i've seen it . i've seen it . i've seen it , but . do you have thit that was . that's about it . so the the important findings are innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group . and colouring is important and and soft materials .
it's quite quite good , yes . it's it , what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel . there's no scenario where you use the button in the scroll-wheel . you just use the wheel . what about mute ? thi this is my volume button . and either on this side or this side and click it to muten the device . that that that's one possibility , . and and it makes it different from the traditional devices on this market . it's quite goods .
it's obvious new . so it might attract the young customers . but it's done before , there are many other devices like telephones and our radio , pocket radios . we use this . and , it's it's been done years ago and don't see it anywhere now . so it's not no . all the sony telephones use it , , for volume . nokia has , , it's not really scroll-wheel , but on their side the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this . yes , but it uses two separate buttons . know , it's not really scroll-wheel .
no , but that's something for roo here to think about . don't have haven't looked for for information about it , but don't nformation don't think you need it on display . especially when when we have to look at cost , don't think 'cause all any t_v_ can can view digit on on screen , . don't think either . don't think you need it . on screen display . my conclusion , unfortunately the market has decided the little other than . the market would like sort titanium casing , but they seem to like natural . so we should think about wood finish . i've chosen the more battery with solar cell solution for the energy .
so if you use titanium . no no , but the that's what sebastian said . the titanium thing we have to skip it . he said this is what this is my personal preference . but but yet , understood that the market is different . so no , rubber with colours . so we should skip the titanium , and we should use wood like that . and , the , the older people liked wood . and would think and they can be implemented with regular chip ? so it it needs to be rubber .
nah , no , don't . sebast nee , roo ? roo , do you have any other nothing more . sebas , we we need to describe decisions now . the the next phase will be the not the what is the next phase flores ? so on the energy , , we decided . the case rubber with one one one curve . user interface then the corporate identity should be in the product . but can't scroll-wheels work with one one-curved case ? yes , they can work .
so on the energy , , we decided . the case rubber with one one one curve . user interface then the corporate identity should be in the product . but can't scroll-wheels work with one one-curved case ? yes , they can work . they cannot work with double-curved . that's that's problem . i'll check it for you . that is something for roo and sebastian . you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .
yes , they can work . they cannot work with double-curved . that's that's problem . i'll check it for you . that is something for roo and sebastian . you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow . keep it in mind . and the buttons , talked about it now . the next phase , sebastian , is the design of the look and feel . the user interface design .
one of you could write it down . you you need to help me . the casing is curved , single-curved . start with the casing . what about the energy source ? traditional batteries and solar . but can there be wor can they work together ? or do we have to choose between them ? 'cause if we have to choose ? no , they can be complementary .
traditional batteries and solar . but can there be wor can they work together ? or do we have to choose between them ? 'cause if we have to choose ? no , they can be complementary . al al every device . it it should be . what if not ? there should be really no problem . they can be supplementary .
we have decided we wanted to use the rubber ? with colourful rubber . if it's possible with different covers , but i'm not if our suppliers can can help us with with such wish . and we should use the company colours . something like black and red . black and yellow . grey and yellow or black and yellow . grey and yellow . grey yellow , . yellow case and grey buttons , .
i'm i'm not so , it should be , i'm not , have to ask with manufacturing , but i'm i'm not that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . can you separate these these do . so if you want the spongy feel , you need to make these buttons all all of rubber . never touch between the buttons . or the the sideways . or the the back . the side , exactly , the sideways . or the back . the side , but do you touch between the the these buttons ? yes , especially when there are few buttons on it , you have lot of space to touch .
yes , especially when there are few buttons on it , you have lot of space to touch . so you just have it in your hand completely or or you play with it . we do not have very much time left . you two have to figure that out . i'm going to leave the decision to you , because you have to make its prototype , and you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and so i'm going to leave it the decision with you . sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ? what about the chips ? we use the regular chip ? and no , that's about it . with those regular chips we can still control advanced functions .
we use the regular chip ? and no , that's about it . with those regular chips we can still control advanced functions . the chip is is not really , . the only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced version of the chip supports . and we've decided not to use . then we are quite finished . i'll see you in thirty minutes and ? for the finishing touch . if you write wrote anything down , could you put it on the shared folder ?
for the finishing touch . if you write wrote anything down , could you put it on the shared folder ? but sebastian has everything . know , but . i'll put it online .
but sebastian has everything . know , but . i'll put it online .
and the voice recognition as , you could could . yes , it's , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our . there are there are many ways of doing things on such device . it's it's quite easy . and and the case is is rubber ? yes , rubber ? and the buttons ? plastic or rubber . there are plastic or rubber . and the colouring ?
yellow with grey or black like that . with with grey or black . whatever cost cost the least . we'll we'll come to that later . anything else to add or . we should think about these buttons . you could use two of them to programme the channels on the two channel button , 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels . but yes , but it but these are tasks that are only executed once , . but you do want programme button to activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . li like that .
my name is not name but , used the the documents . you are nameless . and these were the most important criteria . it should be . that's how the fashion state it . is it spongy ? fancy look and feel . so appar , but we shouldn't evaluate yet . so just walk through it step by step . is it fancy , everything believe believe it's fancy .
it is it is , so . is it fancy ? the yellow rubber , so . you like the rubber , roo . i'm into it . but it's not that fancy . no , i'll i'll i'll give it two . it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing . it would be even more , you really like titanium . you like tita that's flavour as .
the yellow rubber , so . you like the rubber , roo . i'm into it . but it's not that fancy . no , i'll i'll i'll give it two . it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing . it would be even more , you really like titanium . you like tita that's flavour as . i'm i'm into it . it has flavour .
with the voice recognition feature and no , we are evaluating this this design now . but that's not in it . ov or can we . let's let's this product . so it is . and the scroll wheel . the solar not many remotes have the solar , . it could have been little bit more innovative by using the kinetic energy source , but it's it's way too yes , but it's two . and so also two ? that would have been thrill .
the voice recognition is hard to learn , . hard it's not for the for the for the elderly . but there are two parts in this remote control . they won't use it . what you see here is is the basic part . everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . that's for novice user . when you have more advanced , elaborate user , , such user really would like to explore all these additional functions . so in that in that way it is advanced , and it's easy to use for for both types of users . so it's it's not very easy for .
i'll go for the two . so that's ten . so could make it easy ? if you make it four it will be three in general . so that's no , two and half . if he makes it four . six and four . six and four is ten . divided by four is two and half . seven , three no .
seven , three no . four and three together . you have two , he has two . two , two , three no . no , haven't said anything yet . but if would say three , then it's six , and four is ten . divided by four . divided by four is two point five . so if you want to have the conclusion as three three . then you would make four .
no , it's not one of our option , but when you look in the market , when you look yes , but that's not that's not what they are talking about , . this this was most spongy option . so , in the in . because we compare all these characteristics characteristics with market with with the real market . so there are remote controls out there which are lot more spongy . they're out there . they're out there . but in this case in this case we've done the best we could . yes , but it's not good enough , so it's two . i'll give it one .
twenty five euros . and costs were twelve fifty . but even now , if only our production costs were exceeded the double , think . production cost was were was twenty two ? so selling price would be . about fifty euros . that's quite ex , it's not it's not very expensive for remote control that that has this functionality . that's price , but no . an original remote control of any t_v_ kind , phillips remote control , you pay , kn know from few years ago , it it it costed hundred gilders . yes , it's more than fifty euros .
the process was good . ye the prices . but we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . and and that was the the big deal . if we knew that before , we we could have made the the choice between what . actually , we had yes . we had we had too little information actually . so and the the the , looking at room for creativity , there was way too the the choice of components was way too narrow . so there was not really process of yes . so we could we we could be we could've been creative .
actually , we had yes . we had we had too little information actually . so and the the the , looking at room for creativity , there was way too the the choice of components was way too narrow . so there was not really process of yes . so we could we we could be we could've been creative . but it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price . in the first meeting we we already were very creative . we we thought of possibilities who are not possible with the the current offer of manufacturing components . so we're tempered by that , yes . any other thoughts on that ?
no , no . you agree , . roo's on for his promotion . we're good team . so too , it's it's it's laboratory environment . missed it to be able to contact you in between and say , roo . tried once , but that was not allowed . so , but but si when taken in account the the situation , we performed pretty . the means , the smartboard , the digital pen . did you like ?
it's not accurate . the the pointing of the pen is not the place where it it writes its where it , where it draws . it's the drawing on on the on the board is from the pen . so you to take in account that your you it's too slow . it's it needs to be calibrateds . it it was calibrated just before this meeting . the one before , the third meeting . so it's not the calibration , it's the thing itself , . ruud , did you use the pen lot ? it was quite handy thing , although would like to see o_c_r_ .
only use it to draw rabbit , so can't say much about it . you can't really decide . missed feature to easily select slide and distribute it to the laptops . that would be very easy if you could say , want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or or the other way around , that you could show but know . no , or the other way around . yes , yes . that's quite what powerpoint does . but you can if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . know , but know , but we couldn't use that feature , so missed it . so it's almost .
an object , yes . the drawing cap capabilities are very limited . it's not possible . and and you were when you're using windows , you're used to certain interface and certain buttons , which you can use for drawing . and lot of these buttons don't appear here . so it's not not not way . it looks like paint actually . so it it's not even as advanced as paint . it's quite limited . the project is evaluated .
see some action over there . private room , roo . that sounds quite scary . no , let's find the way to . we're done , we're finished , believe . so , are there any more cycles in this process ? don't believe so . we'd get an email . for your forty minutes . but how much time did we get for this meeting ?
don't believe so . we'd get an email . for your forty minutes . but how much time did we get for this meeting ? and how much time is left ? minute or or ten . ten or five . so , we can redesign our would like to . we we we all the redesign should be . simple , dull , one-coloured box .
minute or or ten . ten or five . so , we can redesign our would like to . we we we all the redesign should be . simple , dull , one-coloured box . and no added value . no , it's it's just the same product that is already on the market . so in interesting design . but you see the problem , you can't continue your your line . it's fluffy alright .
you're our marketing expert . my name is dirk , dirk meinfeld . will be pr project the marketing expert . and will see what the user wants and what we can do with the new produ project product . and you are user interface . nick broer , user interface designer . i'm going to look at the technical design from the user point of view . my name is xavier juergens , i'm the industrial designer , and there are three main questions that have to find an answer to today . first one is what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is the apparatus made of , and the third is what should it look like . what should it look like ?
so , draw us your favourite animal . i'm more into the technical aspects of drawing , so i'm not really good at drawing animals , but the animal which . draw us technical animal . it's still erasing . else my animal will be like king-size . like dolphin , because of its its freedom . actually worked with this . it's like it's very high-tech . bit low-responsive though . prefer pen and paper .
it's not really that responsive , no . it's beautiful animal . you have to press it pretty hard . with smile on it , it's very important . it's cute elephant . and not to forget its tail . and you was making comments on my dolphin . will beat the dolphin . so it's just bee . so suggest you make us the elephant in the market .
experience with the tiger . my drawing skills are really bad , so . they are really bad , my drawing skills . i'm not how the legs should go , but these are stripes . i've picked this animal because it's very fast . it is it knows exactly what it wants . it hardly ever wastes any resources . what does it want ? it hunts for prey , but it does it always in very well-thought way . it knows exactly what it wants .
love to draw ants . it's my hobby . just it's very representative what we drew , . like you take just take your freedom and use trendy interface that you design for us . you're supposed to make make it different from from what other people have , and just make it little distinct . another beep to stop the meeting . finish meeting now . put this down . we have little little time extra , but just little quick discussion to to open open our work . so what do you think about the first idea is just very short .
we want suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . so , really disabled people , , might be problem , but it's little take it into consideration . we really need to cut the meeting short . you have anything you wanna share quickly ? only one thing that has to be added according to me is the the material it is made of , it should be something light . that's it speaks for itself , but some . it should be light , . let's see , where did let's skip that . this is it . skipped this sheet .
or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short since we're supposed to stop . no , not really yet , but i've some ideas and will say it . anyways , the the personal coach will give you the your your personal assignments and everything . so we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes . i'm we have that . good luck everyone . i'll see you back here in thirty minutes .
, no problem . there was little problem with my computer so not the whole presentation . anyway , let's see what you have . and want to open the my no . it's still bit open . you should close it on your own notebook , . no , that's . the functional requirements , it's very important for the user , he he wants to . the the method we used it it's not not slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use , we tested it with hundred men , and we asked them to what the remote feel like and what what's important . if cut in , is it people or men ?
is it people , . both women and men , . 'cause it was only men , so . the findings seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . and , most they want to spend money for better system , for better remote control , so we can do little things with it , and they use , they use zap lot , fifty percent say they only so that's the most important things . that's pretty shocking . so we have to we have to do something about that . not all of it is it on mine on my powerpoint presentation , but the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . just talk ahead . it's the most basic buttons that user wants to use .
we wanna have little preview on the remote control . preview what's on the channel . is that manageable ? 'cause it sounds pretty expensive too . that sounds too it's possible , but it's expensive , but do continue . my personal preferences is button for my favourite channel , so , so zap to my quick to my favourite channel wh what so , the remote mu must see or must see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , so zap to what ? you don't set it yourself , it just remembers the channel that you are on most , . you want the you want it to be programmed , programmed or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? let's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , so it recognises your favourite channel . that's what my personal preference like .
you don't set it yourself , it just remembers the channel that you are on most , . you want the you want it to be programmed , programmed or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? let's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , so it recognises your favourite channel . that's what my personal preference like . so it's it it does it recognise itself , you don't have to set it . no , itself . it's easier to to sell it , but it's manageable , but we will we will see . it's little bit it's the end of it . it's little bit lost it , the computer crashed , so . no problem , it's it's , that's , go ahead .
it's really good idea . now work little with me . let's start it as it is . there are few questions that need to be answered , you already talked about it little bit . which buttons are wanted , is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need something like mode that you can switch it . because then the buttons have to send out different signal then they would normally do . and how big is the remote control going to be ? i'll tell you why that's important to me . there are lot of technical parts in the remote control , so that's why also would like to say go little bit easy on the designs , heard ab you talking about beeps and about video screens , but the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already .
no , this is good idea . but go ahead . is it manageable ? with with an screen you can why ? is it easy ? we should lose the screen , like you said . yes , so too . it's it's huge the is huge , it consumes batteries like hell . it takes up lot of lot of power . and it costs too much to fabricate , so we're on tight budget here .
we should lose the screen , like you said . yes , so too . it's it's huge the is huge , it consumes batteries like hell . it takes up lot of lot of power . and it costs too much to fabricate , so we're on tight budget here . it costs lot , . what we could do , what could be possible , is not an screen but with preview , but i'm not if it's even possible . little t_v_ guide . like you have little just just text only , not colour , just little text thing so you can use your remote as t_v_ guide . i'm not it's even possible , but , make it , find little compromise in that , but what did write down ?
have to check that out , i'm not . the , the beep is very simple thing to imple implement , just make button on your t_v_ and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . that must be possible . it's easy to implement , we should go for that . i'm , whe where do you wanna hit the t_ you wanna we want button on the television . and it's just slap-on sticker with button which sends out small signal . thin , where else should you put it ? in , but that rules out universal remote control . because that's not possible . but how are you gonna use that if your if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ?
in , but that rules out universal remote control . because that's not possible . but how are you gonna use that if your if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ? you mean as like separate thing you can attach to your t_v_ . that could be possible . little little box you can attach to your t_v_ is fine then , . then i'd i'd like to know now if we want the universal remote control or not , because that's determines everything i'm gonna do . we should go for universal , because we're separate company making separate remote controls to sell to lot of diverse people . universal remote control should be possible . everyone wants to buy it , so we .
that is true . no , that's true . no , don't . because the television needs to respond to the signal , and if it doesn't know how , it's exactly , that's not possible . it's an in-built menu , isn't it ? so we or we could use double-sided for less used functions you , with the cover . i'm not if it's impossible , but there's chance it's not , so . double-sided remote control ? don't think that's useful . it's an idea to overcome these issues , because no , but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used .
do you take triangles or it should be it we should make bigger or whatever . it's it's fine , . this is what people are accustomed to , so , but this is just general idea . the menu button can go in the middle . in the middle . it's it's usually there , but . perhaps we should also make something like flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf . they they won't hear the the beep . but if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash . you won't be able to find it .
that thing should be central . you shouldn't be you shouldn't press it by accident , but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere . that's it's and but you and you are reading from the you always read from the top to the the bottom of it . usually press it on top . at least that's what i'm accustomed to . have another idea , i'm not if it's possible . like that's gonna work . what would you like to ? we should move the buttons down and put it here to from top to bottom . that's true , you should the bu the power button should be on top , 'cause it's the first thing you do , turn it on .
turn the sound off . no , it's no . 'cause i'm accustomed to it over here , at least in general , but it's not that important , no . don't t's important , but it it should be you you could put it somewhere here . or or with the volume selection . no , because it , people are accustomed to that , it's can have that ? around not not at top at the around the volume selection . where exactly , but wha no . that's take this out and here see are we gonna take triangles anyway ? i'm drawing triangles , but , it's bigger lesser than thing .
so anyway , this is should be the channels and or sh here , . i'm accustomed to the channels being on top . should we chan , this two , channel up and down . shall we also look if it's possible to make rechargeable remote ? that you don't have to buy new batteries if every , . for that is it's on one part it's it's good thing to recharge it we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries . it's more ex expensive . you have just put penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it's an it's it's it's very annoying . but that's already possible . but isn't that expensive in the entire package ?
that you don't have to buy new batteries if every , . for that is it's on one part it's it's good thing to recharge it we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries . it's more ex expensive . you have just put penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it's an it's it's it's very annoying . but that's already possible . but isn't that expensive in the entire package ? i'm not i'm not it's if it's expensive , but just take look at it , because it might be very good idea . because if it's it's useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch t_v_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour . you could make device , but i'm not how that is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , but it you're the remote also can act as recharger . how about have idea .
i'm not if it costs lot , that that's what he that's that you that's what you buy yourself . i'm going to try to find that out . i'm not if there's information available on this , but . it's just an idea , we have to find out if it's possible . but , they want to pay for it . to pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ? do they want but they want rechargeable one ? i'm not , you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important . there was not el ask esque but but . these are comfort issues .
do they want but they want rechargeable one ? i'm not , you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important . there was not el ask esque but but . these are comfort issues . so people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort . this is comfort . they want to pay for comfort , we just assu we we could either make separate station which just sends signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , and , we have to either that or make it integrated with with docking station . this is brilliant product . would buy it myself . it would be good actually .
no , it wasn't wasn't allo it was possible , not allowed , so . no , it's not . so that's why i'm not that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft . my computer crashed , so lost my presentation , but have the , but here have the the the homepage of our internet , and here is my here is my marketing report , you ca you can look at that and . haven't heard any complaints yet , so . the , they inc they include the new one . have your powerpoint presentation , get some inf information out of that . or just for you . where would we where would we want the teletext button ? no , didn't have that .
no , didn't have that . because we decided that it's not that important . and one and wha what people want , i've have another thing . all it tells just let's make make new tick the new one . do we put it somewhere over here ? let's increase it little because , draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , so the more less important more or less . or this is something for the next meeting , draw out some ideas . we have decided more or less the basic structure . put the other buttons in . just play little with this , put shift little up or down and we'll see what looks best .
philips has this . have no clue . drew something what which would fit into your hand easily . to make it futuristic . realise if we make it small , then it needs to be little thicker , because need to put all the electronics in it . if we make it smaller , less wide , then we need to make it little thicker , because have to put all the electronics in it . but you have to just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy . we can stick it in in there , . even if in the worst case we can even could you give me the pen back ? so what , .
personally would prefer it on the top . i'm i'm still not convinced of the . you would prefer it . so we have three people saying it should be on top . but then you would would have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . it's expensive to build it , so you must use the maximum of it . this looks little about the l_c_d_s thing . it if it's if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it , because it's it's . they want it . we should just try to make that if it's possible .
we have green now or we should we could draw draw something bit that has it on on on the bottom . do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he would we like to press it in the middle ? in middle of it . in the middle . in circle , like we like in this example . this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons . for up and down , ma make it circle on it , because it the channel button should be in the centre . yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , because it's the most important function . it's the most import . channel button should be st stick together , here in this section .
in middle of it . in the middle . in circle , like we like in this example . this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons . for up and down , ma make it circle on it , because it the channel button should be in the centre . yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , because it's the most important function . it's the most import . channel button should be st stick together , here in this section . because it's we're not about the size anyway , just general design . that would make them quite small .
so of name . let's think of name , . at anyways , the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , so there we go . so yes , go and finish up and i'll see you at lunch . i've do we save the ?
there we go . here we are again . detailed design , come on . forgot to insert the minutes , but it's about the same thing we discussed before . could open that anyway , think . other design anyway , we took as we took we took rubber as as the material last time . we also that you're just busy with it . took the advanced chip to implement the advanced features . we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the other screen , which is fine . we that the colour should be yellow and black .
it's more or less the same as we had . it's what we upon , but just little bit more specified . that's hasn't changed that much , ? no much no no no , not . didn't expect anyway . you just coloured it . in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see over here . we chose different type of colour for the menu . like the menu . bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad .
although we are demolishing little bit the style . but the and . the colour is more important than the really the curve , because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control so black and grey is . it's it it does ruin it , but the fact that took that decision or took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the the possibility of adding your own custom covers . the people spongy , . so you can change any colour you want . so it's just you deliver basic remote control with possibility to change you into whatever you want . can we then not also change the material ? we take plastic for the basic cover and we can put those to the to the other covers . you can take plastic , but it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , because they're all plastic .
so which in in turn rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break . but what do you then suggest we'd lose ? because we have to lose two things and . al like said , lost the speech recognition and lost the special colour , which would make this black black and grey . and that's enough ? that's that that that's enough , because those are the basic colours . which we can fabricate , . those are basic col they want to to ensure the profit . that that's that's the order . we're just we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this .
the menus things like brightness and those things we've put in the menu , because we have no buttons for those . the menu options . in the screen . no , in the screen , the small screen . what does it display ? and for channel selection , or that's not , too but . thought it was it was that people wanted previews on their i'm not if that even possible , but 'cause it's this requires quite quite bit of band-width . don't t's possible really . but the they didn't really define in what should be used for . but t_v_ guide in your .
or we could say it or we could say neutral , we 'cause we scratched the no , we don't have the colour . it can't talk anymore . so we scrap that . just to be prick , but you can talk to your remote control , it doesn't do anything . but you you can talk to it . not with the speech recognition . all the trends and no colours anymore . so , only in the curves . we did take everything into consideration . the shape shape is we , that's .
on the last one . that that's all . it's ten , sixteen three two two point seven like that . one two three . two two point some two point something . ten , sixteen , divided by is two two third . two and two thirds . so we can say it's it's the product is it's . it's , but that's yo mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . there's , if we make it into four , as in neutral , because we didn't implement it , so we can't say that we that it's really not mplemented .
have no clue . that's like oh,but it should if the project is evaluated and it was it was in within budget , we should celebrate . so , think that's about it . bring out the beer . want one for my own . i'm not what we should still do though let's see wh your tasks were finished , ? what you ha from your assistant . have no more email . so let's , should sh still have the the total report to finish up . my coach is being very silent now .
what you ha from your assistant . have no more email . so let's , should sh still have the the total report to finish up . my coach is being very silent now . my personal coach what , name . we took very little time now , because , we're in agreement , everything the design is . the one thing we missed though , we don't have product name . no , we haven't think above about that . how about you cook how about you cook up product name ? it's better than thi than serial number .
it's better than thi than serial number . sony t_r_ something means nothing to me . or fruit name . just , think of catchy name . like fruit names . i'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps . fruit name like that . the banana remote . you don't want it to resemble banana . it's the form of it .
at least it's not something with numbers . numbers are so meaningless to the people . reaction , real reaction . there's something on the website which will help us out . the reaction deluxe . real reaction future r_c_ . step into the future of of remote controlling your t_v_ . is that name or campaign ? no that's that's catchy slogan . or the the real reactor .
no that's that's catchy slogan . or the the real reactor . control your remote control . go for future r_c_ probably . something like it's short real reactor ? the real reactor , don't find that that bad . you should write it down as an option . because our name is real reaction . that that's that makes me think of different products than remote control really . real reaction in real real reactor .
take , take banana . banana recei r_c_ . real reaction remotes control . do you mean it like you mean it like this ? real reaction remote control . no , not like that . it should be it should be longer , because it's not product name that you print on box . just write out triple , like word triple r_c_ , triple stripe . triple dash dash c_ . the triple r_c_ , .
can't we take this one ? sh , , will ask you when need the information . otherwise we have to do it all over again . don't really know whether we can save it as picture or no . is it if try ? is that with you ? i'll put it back in minute . it has been saving something , but where to . can say exp yes , . export as j_ peg .
